Model selection in high dimensions is an active subject of research, ranging from machine learning and/or artificial intelligence algorithms, to statistical inference, and sometimes a mix of the two. We focus on the frequentist approach to model selection in view of presenting methods that have the necessary properties for out-of-sample (or population) validity, within an as large as possible theoretical framework that enables the measurement of different aspects of the validity concept. We therefore anchor the content into an inferential statistics approach, essentially for causal models. More specifically, the focus of model selection in high dimensions is presented into two main headings, one on statistical methods or criteria for measuring the statistical validity, and the other one on fast algorithms in high dimensional settings, both in the number of observation and in the number of inputs, that avoid the simultaneous comparison of all possible models. Even within this focus, the set of available methods is still very rich, so that only a selection of the available methods is presented. Each presentation is accompanied with practical exercises using R. We highly recommend downloading RStudio’s IDE which is an ideal working environment for statistical analyses. 1.2.1 Bibliography (to be completed) Computer Age Statistical Inference: Algorithms, Evidence, and Data Science.

The choice of the R editor depends on how R is used and for this class, we propose the open source editor RStudio. We also highly recommend the introduction proposed in SMAC, which will constitute the basic knowledge from which this class starts. 1.3.1 Useful R packages The R packages that will be used throughout this class are the following (to be completed): rmarkdown quantmod plotly tidyr dplyr RODBC pool RMySQL foreign leaps glmulti MuMIn caret mvtnorm MASS tictoc pROC selectiveInference SIS rpart rpart.plot glmnet To install a package, use the R command install.packages(&quot;chosen.package.name&quot;) (see also https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/).

Blanc) Data are nowadays continuously produced and readily available from internet platforms. This has become necessary since very often personal computer memory is not sufficient to store (high dimensional) data locally. It is therefore important to be able to import data into R for data analysis in an (almost) automatic fashion. Colloquially, `loading’ a dataset means storing it into your computer’s Random-Access-Memory (RAM), which allows for a fast access of the CPU to the data. The RAM is extremely fast1, but is typically of limited amount compared to what can be stored in a hard-drive or a SSD (usually 4 to 16 Gbs in a typical consumer-grade computer). The data stored in your computer’s RAM is called volatile: the information it contains will disappear once the computer is shut down. This is the reason why the datasets must be loaded into R at the beginning of each session. In this section, you will learn different ways to load the data that you may encounter in the future, depending on the context and the size of the databases: from an R package, from a local data file, from an online data file, and from an online database. In this latter case, datasets are obtained by way of SQL queries via a remote connection. Follow along and load all the datasets as in the text: they will be used for the following exercises. 1.3.3 Loading data from an R package (by G. Blanc) Some packages have their own data included, and R-base indeed includes a well known selection, for instance the iris dataset. You can load it using: # Load the iris dataset iris &lt;- iris and display its structure with: # Display iris&#39; structure str(iris) ## &#39;data.frame&#39;: 150 obs. of 5 variables: ## $ Sepal.Length: num 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ... ## $ Sepal.Width : num 3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ... ## $ Petal.Length: num 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ... ## $ Petal.Width : num 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ... ## $ Species : Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... The dataset iris is now ready for analysis. 1.3.4 Loading data from a local file (by G. Blanc) Typical file formats include .txt and .csv, or .data. Download the file wine.data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/ to a folder on your computer, say in ./datasets/. You can load the data using the read.table function, which takes as further input sep = &quot;,&quot; to indicate that the variables in each line are separated by a comma. These variables will be organized as columns in the dataset.Every line of the file becomes a row in the dataset. wine &lt;- read.table(&quot;./datasets/wine.data&quot;, sep = &quot;,&quot;) 1.3.5 Loading data from an online file (by G. Blanc) The end result will be the same as above, but the process is less tedious, provided you have an internet connection. Simply load the data using the complete url as an input for read.table: wine &lt;- read.table(&quot;http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine/wine.data&quot;, sep = &quot;,&quot;) A quick look at the structure of the dataset shows that the columns do not have names that describe their content. Let’s change that: # format the data.frame: colnames(wine) &lt;- c(&quot;Class&quot;, &quot;Alcohol&quot;, &quot;Malic_acid&quot;, &quot;Ash&quot;, &quot;Alcalinity_of_ash&quot;, &quot;Magnesium&quot;, &quot;Total_phenols&quot;, &quot;Flavanoids&quot;, &quot;Nonflavanoid_phenols&quot;, &quot;Proanthocynins&quot;, &quot;Color_intensity&quot;, &quot;Hue&quot;, &quot;OD280vsOD315&quot;, &quot;Proline&quot;) wine$Class &lt;- as.factor(wine$Class) The dataset wine is now ready for analysis. 1.3.6 Loading data from an online database using a mySQL query (Optional) (by G. Blanc) The most common way to store massive, related data from different sources is to use relational databases. These consists of multiple datasets (tables), that may be related in some specific way. For instance, an online shop may have a table listing all of its registered clients, and another table listing all the orders made by the clients. In this example, the clients will have a unique identifier that will establish the relation between the two databases. A database is an organized collection of data. A relational database (see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database), more restrictively, is a collection of schema, tables, queries, reports, views, and other elements. A database-management system (DBMS) is a computer-software application that interacts with end-users (you), other applications that you may develop (e.g., an Rmarkdown document), and the database itself to capture and analyze data. Relational databases organize data into one or more tables of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Generally, each table/relation represents one “entity type” (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as “Lee” or “chair”) and the columns represent values attributed to that instance (such as “address” or “price”). The databases can be stored - offline, on a non-volatile memory (for instance your hard drive or SSD drive), or - online, which require an internet connection to access. You will usually need credentials (a username and a password) to access either databases. As we will see, there are many advantages of relational databases which explain their almost universal use when it comes to storing massive amount of data online. The main advantages are that they: avoid data duplication, avoid inconsistent records, allow easily to change or add/remove the data, are more secure. To access the data store on the database, you will need to establish a connection, for which we will need RStudio’s pool package. library(pool) # Establish a connection to the external database con &lt;- dbPool( drv = RMySQL::MySQL(), dbname = &quot;shinydemo&quot;, host = &quot;shiny-demo.csa7qlmguqrf.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com&quot;, username = &quot;guest&quot;, password = &quot;guest&quot; ) We can explore the database and list the tables that it contains using dbListTables: # Explore the tables available in the database: dbListTables(con) ## [1] &quot;City&quot; &quot;Country&quot; &quot;CountryLanguage&quot; Remember that each table is a different dataset. Some databases are very big, in the BigData sense: think millions, even billions of entries. SQL queries allow to cherry pick the data we need, without having to download the whole dataset (which would be in some cases unfeasible). In a typical use, we would then query the data that we need, and no more. Since this is not a mySQL course and our datasets are of reasonable size, we will simply download the three datasets entirely using the SQLquery SELECT * FROM (Table). # Download the three datasets City &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select * from City&quot;) Country &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select * from Country&quot;) CountryLanguage &lt;- DBI::dbGetQuery(con, &quot;select * from CountryLanguage&quot;) poolClose(con) Exercise: - Load the iris dataset from the R-base package - Load the wine dataset from a local file and from an online file using the URL directly - Load the datasets City, Country, and CountryLanguage by connecting to an online database 1.3.7 Data Wrangling (by G. Blanc) Data wrangling means to manipulate and prepare a dataset in such a way, that it becomes amenable to analysis. Minimally, a numerical dataset is stored as a Matrix object, a type optimized for computations. Preferably, however, a dataset is stored as a dataframe object. A dataframe is technically a list of columns, each containing data of a given type (e.g., integer, numerical, character, factor). Many packages, and indeed R-base itself, are optimized to have the data organized in the following way: each row represent one observation each column represents a variable (or `feature’) There are two packages dedicated to data wrangling in R: dplyr is a grammar of data wrangling, which focuses on efficient and elegant coding data.table is computationally extremely fast to manipulate very large datasets Both create objects that are extensions of dataframes: dplyr uses a tibble, and data.table uses a data.table. We do not recommend to use data.table in this course, as it has a steeper learning curve. Using dplyr is not necessary either to complete the course; however, it will save you time in the end and is a worthwhile investment. For a quick reference, download the official cheatsheet. Exercise: We will assume that the datasets iris, wine, City, Country, and CountryLanguage of the above section have all been loaded in R, as well as the package dplyr. library(dplyr) Comment on the type of variables of the iris dataset. Write a code that computes the mean of each variable, grouped by Species. Do it first using R-base only, and optionally, do it using dplyr. variables.to.average &lt;- c(&quot;Sepal.Length&quot;, &quot;Sepal.Width&quot;, &quot;Petal.Length&quot;, &quot;Petal.Width&quot;) species.types &lt;- c(&quot;setosa&quot;, &quot;versicolor&quot;, &quot;virginica&quot;) # levels(iris$Species) # # Method 1A: without dplyr using a for loop; outputs a matrix species.means1 &lt;- NULL for(type in species.types){ is.species &lt;- iris$Species==type species.subset &lt;- iris[is.species, variables.to.average] species.means1 &lt;- rbind(species.means1, colMeans(species.subset)) } rownames(species.means1) &lt;- species.types # # Method 1B: more compact and efficient; outputs a matrix species.means2 &lt;- t(sapply(species.types, function(species){ colMeans(iris[iris$Species==species, variables.to.average]) })) # # Method 2: using dplyr; outputs a dataframe species.means3 &lt;- iris %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarise_all(mean) species.means3 ## # A tibble: 3 x 5 ## Species Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 setosa 5.01 3.43 1.46 0.246 ## 2 versicolor 5.94 2.77 4.26 1.33 ## 3 virginica 6.59 2.97 5.55 2.03 Using the method of your choice, plot the boxplots of alcohol levels of the three classes of wine from the wine dataset. boxplot(Alcohol ~ Class, data=wine, xlab=&quot;Class of wine&quot;, ylab=&quot;Alcohol concentration&quot;) Create 6 boxplots displaying the alcohol level of wine by class (3 levels) and by degree of color intensity (2 levels: above or below 5.0). Optional: compute the corresponding means using dplyr. # Create a new binary variable, called Color_intensity_factor to denote whether the color is mild or intense. wine$Color_intensity_factor &lt;- factor(wine$Color_intensity&gt;5, levels=c(FALSE, TRUE), labels=c(&quot;mild&quot;, &quot;intense&quot;)) # Create the boxplots using the standard formulae boxplot(Alcohol ~ Color_intensity_factor + Class, data=wine, xlab=&quot;Class of wine&quot;, ylab=&quot;Alcohol concentration&quot;) # # Compute the alcohol means of each subgroup using dplyr wine %&gt;% group_by(Class, Color_intensity_factor) %&gt;% summarise_at(&quot;Alcohol&quot;, mean) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## # Groups: Class [?] ## Class Color_intensity_factor Alcohol ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 mild 13.4 ## 2 1 intense 13.9 ## 3 2 mild 12.3 ## 4 2 intense 12.4 ## 5 3 mild 13.0 ## 6 3 intense 13.2 Consider the three datasets City, Country, and CountryLanguage. Merge the three datasets into a single one using the method of your choice, such that no information is lost. Compare the total number of entries in the three relational datasets, to that of the unique dataset. What do you notice? [Hint: notice that “country” is the common relation among the three datasets] # We observe that &quot;country&quot; is the common relation among all datasets. # Let&#39;s try to merge all datasets into a single one using this key # # Merge all cities with country attributes data.merged &lt;- left_join(City, Country, by=c(&quot;CountryCode&quot; = &quot;Code&quot;)) %&gt;% left_join(CountryLanguage, by=&quot;CountryCode&quot;) # we observe that all the data pertaining to the countries appear multiple times. #The total number of data &quot;cells&quot; of the merged data set is 27031*22 = 594682, as compared to the original 24656 data &quot;cells&quot;, that is about 24 times bigger to store the same information. 1.4 Writing reports In this Section, information is provided about one convenient way to produce reports when working in teams. To be able to participate in the construction of this eBook, only text (including R chunks) in RMarkdown will be accepted. 1.4.1 R Markdown RMarkdown is a framework that provides a literate programming format for data science. It can be used to save and execute R code within R Studio and also as a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, ODT, RTF, and MS Word documents as well as seamless transitions between available formats. For example this eBook is written using R Markdown. We recommend the introduction proposed in https://smac-group.github.io/ds/rmarkdown.html to rapidly get acquainted with the use of R Markdown. Exercises with Iris dataset (see Loading data from an R package) Create an .rmd file from R Studio classic interface and look at the basic notions explained in the new document Create an histogram of the sepal width of Iris Setosa without showing both the code and the graph. Then, in another code chunk, show only the graph (without the code) and change the height or width of the histogram as you prefer Write the formula, both inline and with a Latex environment (e.g. equation), of the conditional probability of observing an Iris Virginica given that the sepal width is greater than 3. Display both the code and the conditional probability Inline formula with Dollar operator: \\(P(\\; virginica / \\; sepal.width &gt; 3) = \\frac{P(virginica \\; \\&amp; \\; sepal.width &gt; 3)}{P(sepal.width &gt; 3)} = 0.254\\) Latex enviroment equation: \\[\\begin{equation*} P(\\; virginica / \\; sepal.width &gt; 3) = \\frac{P(virginica \\; \\&amp; \\; sepal.width &gt; 3)}{P(sepal.width &gt; 3)} = 0.254 \\end{equation*}\\] sub_joint = subset(iris,iris$Species == &quot;virginica&quot; &amp; iris$Sepal.Width &gt; 3) sub_marg = iris$Sepal.Width[iris$Sepal.Width &gt; 3] result = dim(sub_joint)[1]/length(sub_marg) result ## [1] 0.2537313 1.4.2 GitHub GitHub (https://github.com/) is a development platform designed to host and review code, manage projects, and build software alongside millions of other developers. An introduction to the use of Github for managing projects (e.g. a data analysis project), we recommend https://smac-group.github.io/ds/github.html. Students following this course will be stimulated to complete the exercises and practicals and provide their solutions that will be published in the eBook. GitHub provides a platform for team work that is strongly encouraged.

Both a manifestation and a cause of poverty, malnutrition is thought to contribute to over a third of death in children under five years old globally (United Nations Children’s Fund 2012). Moreover, it is well established in the medical literature that maternal and child under nutrition have considerable consequences for adult health and human capital (see e.g. Victora et al. (2008) and the references therein). Such conditions are, for example, associated with less schooling, reduced economic productivity, and for women lower offspring birth weight. It has also been reported that lower birth weight and under nutrition in childhood have an influence on cancer occurrence and are risk factors for high glucose concentrations, blood pressure, and harmful lipid profiles. See also https://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:29628, p. 64. Under nutrition is generally assessed by comparing anthropometric indicators such as height or weight at a certain age to a reference population. A well established measurement for the study of acute malnutrition is given by (see cite {who1995physical} for details): \\[\\begin{equation} Y_i = \\frac{H_{i,j} - \\mu_j}{\\sigma_{j}} \\label{eq:Zscore} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(H_{i,j}\\), \\(\\mu_j\\) and \\(\\sigma_j\\) denote, respectively, the height of the \\(i^{\\text{th}}\\) child at age \\(j\\), the median height of a child of the same age in the reference population and the associated standard deviation. Several factors are assumed to have a determinant influence on under nutrition. Consider the dataset Zambia.SAV available at Course Datasets - Malnutrition in Zambia containing variables assumed to be potential causes for childhood malnutrition, i.e. breastfeeding duration (month); age of the child (month); age of the mother (years); Body Mass Index (BMI) of the mother (kg/meter\\(^2\\)); height of the mother (meter); weight of the mother (kg); region of residence (9 levels: Central, Copperbelt, Eastern, Luapula, Lusaka, Northern, Northwestern, Southern and Western); mother’s highest education level attended (4 levels: No education, Primary, Secondary and Higher); wealth index factor score; weight of child at birth (kg) ; sex of the child; interval between the current birth and the previous birth (month); and main source of drinking water (8 levels: Piped into dwelling, Piped to yard/plot, Public tap/standpipe, Protected well, Unprotected well, River/dam/lake/ponds/stream/canal/ irrigation channel, Bottled water, Other). Exercise (4.1.1) Load the dataset and build the variables so that they can be used for a regression analysis. Associate proper names to each variable (hint: look at the previous comments in the r chunk). Perform a linear regression on all the available variables. Reduce the number of covariates (e.g. using the t-test) and add some interactions. Perform a linear regression on the new dataset. Analyse your chosen estimated model with a residual analysis (e.g. residuals vs fitted plot, normal QQ plot etc.). 1.5.2 Prognostic Factors in Childhood Leukemia (by C. Miglioli) Factors that can affect a child’s outlook (prognosis) suffering e.g. from Leukemia are called prognostic factors. They help doctors decide whether a child with leukemia should receive standard treatment or more intensive treatment. Prognostic factors seem to be more determinant in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) than in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). See https://www.cancer.org/cancer/leukemia-in-children/detection-diagnosis-staging/prognostic-factors.html for a detailed explanation. The leukemia_big.csv dataset contains gene expression measurements on 72 leukemia patients: 47 ALL (i.e. acute lymphocytic leukemia) and 25 AML (i.e. acute myelogenous leukemia). These data arise from the landmark of Golub et al. (1999) Science paper and exhibit an important statistical challenge because \\(p &gt;&gt; n\\) as we deal with 72 patients and 7128 measurements. Exercises (4.1.2) Load the data from the URL http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/DATA/leukemia_big.csv Create the response variable y according to the number of ALL and AML patients. In the same fashion create the matrix X of independent variables. See https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/DATA/leukemia.html for further details. Choose the correct exponential family for this situation and perform a GLM on the data. Comment on the results that you obtain. 1.5.3 R package quantmod The quantmod package for R (https://www.quantmod.com/) is designed to assist the quantitative trader in the development, testing, and deployment of statistically based trading models. We are here interested in the easy and rapid access to data. It is possible with one quantmod function to load data from a variety of sources, including Yahoo! Finance (OHLC data), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis FRED® (11,000 economic series), Google Finance (OHLC data), Oanda, The Currency Site (FX and Metals), etc. Below are some examples on how to load financial data and perform some simple data analysis. A getting started guide to quantmod can be found at https://www.quantmod.com/examples/intro/. The first step is to install the quantmod package (only once), using the install.packages in R. Also install the plotly package for nice plots. Then try the following: # Load quantmod # library(quantmod) # Download data # today &lt;- Sys.Date() # three_month_ago &lt;- seq(today, length = 2, by = &quot;-3 month&quot;)[2] # getSymbols(&quot;AAPL&quot;, from = three_month_ago, to = today) # getSymbols(&quot;NFLX&quot;, from = three_month_ago, to = today) # Produce a # candleChart(NFLX, theme=&#39;white&#39;) # candleChart(AAPL, theme=&#39;white&#39;) 1.6 Fundamental statistical concepts 1.6.1 Sample and population If data are collected, stored, analysed, it is because the are supposed to provide information that cannot be otherwise available. Most of the information that is sought concerns sufficiently general phenomena that, in fact, nobody know (or will ever know) exactly. As an illustration, take the example of a teacher that computes the average score of the last math test in his class, what he gets is the exact information about the average score for that particular class and particular test, at the particular moment when the test took place and when the teacher marked the copies. Any other inference from the available information (the sample) to another context is subject to sampling variability and hence is not exact. If the teacher uses the average score to somehow evaluate the difficulty of his math test, then what he has observed within his class is only a part of the truth. For that purpose (evaluating the difficulty of the math test), he should let all the possible students (the population) pass the test and compute the average of the resulting scores of all of them. This is of course not possible, but statistical methodology can help in targetting the question of interest summarized here by the scores average, by providing, for example, a finite set of possible values for the true average, the one computed virtually on the population, also called a parameter. 1.6.2 Models and risk When the sample per se is not the target (i.e. in most of the cases), then one enters into the process of inference: what can we say about what happens in the population, given a sample of data, supposedly carrying enough information for that purpose? A fundamental aspect of statistical inference is the ability of constructing (manageable) measures of variability to any data treatment operated in order to produce information that is used, in its context, to e.g.: understand the phenomenon under investigation, to predict, to evaluate research hypotheses, etc. The inference concept implies two subsequent questions that are at the core of statistics. On the one hand, one has to define what is the population information of interest, and, on the second hand, one has to provide an inferential risk, i.e. a measure of risk associated to any inference made from the sample to the population. The first concept can be associated, very broadly, to the model, i.e. a set of input (a priori) information that serves to formalize the information of interest. The second concept which is a direct consequence of a function of the sampling variability, can be associated to a (set of) propability, a fundamental measure in statistics. Sometimes, and even more and more often, the two concepts are untangled, in the sense that the model can be very flexible (it is actually a set of models) and a risk measure is used to somehow define a (or a drastically reduced set of) model. This vas-et-vient process could be used to define model selection in statistics. Finally, while the model (or the set of models) is, in general, set a priori, the inferential risk needs to be estimated from the available information, i.e. the sample itself. For that purpose, the fundamental instrument is probability theory. 1.6.3 Estimators and associated variability Consider the simplest decisional setting, i.e. confidence intervals for population parameters. We adopt here a frequentist approach. Population parameters can be quantities of interest, e.g. the population mean, the population proportion (for something specific), the population probability (e.g. of being bankrupt or of surviving a given treatment), or more elaborate quantities such as inequality or poverty measures (see e.g. Cowell (2011)). Very generally, consider an estimator \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) from a population parameter \\(\\theta\\in\\Theta\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^p\\) that is computed on a sample \\(F^{(n)}\\)2 generated for a (family of) model \\(F\\). The latter can be parametric, non parametric or semi-parametric. We can write \\(\\hat{\\theta}(F)\\), i.e. the estimator as a functional (or function of a distribution) of \\(F\\); in particular, we can write \\(\\hat{\\theta}(F^{(n)})\\). For example, the sample mean, an estimator of the population mean \\(\\mu\\), can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\mu}\\left(F^{(n)}\\right)=\\int x dF^{(n)}(x)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\end{equation}\\] An estimator is first chosen for the population parameter and then a confidence interval is built (estimated from the data) that depends on some underlying assumptions about the data generating process. This requires calculating the properties of estimators \\(\\hat{\\theta}(F^{(n)})\\) at distribution \\(F\\) (which is unknown, only assumed). To do so, there are several strategies which include (see Efron and Hastie (2016), chapter 2): The plug-in principle: The variance (or any other moment of the distribution) of \\(\\hat{\\theta}(F^{(n)})\\) is expressed (theoretically) as a function of population parameters (e.g. the population mean, variance, higher moments) and the population parameters in the formula are replaced by estimators computed from the sample. General results on classes of estimators such as the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) or \\(M\\)-estimators (Huber and Ronchetti 2009) can be used for the plug-in principle. Taylor-series approximations: Let \\(T(\\hat{\\theta})\\) be a function of interest of \\(\\hat{\\theta}(F^{(n)})\\), one can use local linear approximations, method that is also sometimes known as the delta method. One considers the linear expansion of \\(T(\\hat{\\theta})\\) around \\(T(\\theta)\\) and uses the approximation \\(T(\\hat{\\theta})=T(\\theta)+\\partial/\\partial\\theta^T T(\\theta)\\left(\\hat{\\theta}-\\theta\\right)\\) together with the plug-in principle to get an estimator of \\(T(\\hat{\\theta})\\). For example, the variance of \\(T(\\hat{\\theta})\\) can be estimated by \\(\\left(\\partial/\\partial\\theta^T T(\\theta)\\right)\\text{var}(\\hat{\\theta})\\left(\\partial/\\partial\\theta^T T(\\theta)\\right)^T\\) in which the unknown \\(\\theta\\) is replaced by its estimated value. Using the functional notation, approximations can be found using von Mises expansions, together with Gâteaux differentials for multidimensional functionals (see e.g. Fernholz (2001)). Simulation and the bootstrap: The basic idea is to implement the infinite sequence of future trials using simulated samples in almost infinite quantities. An estimator \\(\\hat{F}\\) of \\(F\\) is first chosen, then samples \\(F_k^{(n)},k=1,\\ldots,B\\) (\\(B\\) is the almost infinite quantity) are simulated from \\(\\hat{F}\\) to compute estimates \\(\\hat{\\theta}^{(k)}:=\\hat{\\theta}(F_k^{(n)})\\). This produces an estimate for the distribution of \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) that can be used to compute the required quantities such mean, variance, quantiles, etc. Simulation based inference is quite different to traditional methods based on the plug-in principle in that an estimator is sought for \\(F\\) instead of estimators for population parameters. The natural question to ask at this point is what is the best approach to measure risk (sampling error) associated to a statistic (a functional of the sample distribution)? In a frequentist paradigm, one can rely on concepts such as the minimum variance or mean squared error of the resulting estimator (an asymptotic concept also called efficiency) and/or the rate of convergence of the resulting estimator (related to the asymptotic concept of consistency), i.e. how does the estimator converge to the corresponding population quantity as a function of the sample size \\(n\\). There is no unifying theory providing an optimality result for all settings, rather general results for classes of models, estimators and/or simulation-based methods. 1.6.4 Simulating the population using resampling techniques (See Efron and Hastie (2016), chapter 10) Generally speaking, resampling techniques allow to simulate the population, or more precisely, the sampling mechanism of an infinte number of trials (samples). The unspoiled and unique proxy for the population (model) is the sample \\(F^{(n)}\\). For finite populations of size \\(N\\) (that can be huge), a sample of independently drawn observations (i.e. the iid case) can be seen as one realization of \\(n\\) draws from a multinomial distribution with \\(N\\) equally probable (\\(1/N\\)) outcomes corresponding to the \\(N\\) population values. This suggests that a suitable proxy to this data generating mechanism (in the iid case) is to proceed with \\(n\\) draws from a multinomial distribution with \\(n\\) equally probable (\\(1/n\\)) outcomes corresponding to the \\(n\\) sample values. This is what the non parametric Bootstrap (Efron 1979) does. Exercise (optional): The aim here is to reproduce the non parametric Bootstrap and compare it with Monte Carlo simulations. Use as an example the Theil Inequality Index (see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil_index) together with the Generalized Beta Distribution of the second kind. For the sampling part, control the seed (see help(set.seed) in R). Use both the sample command in R and the Uniform distribution to produce the random draws. - Produce (with both methods) the Bootstrap estimate of the sampling distribution of the Theil Inequality Index (of size 1000) for one chosen set of values for the parameters of the Generalized Beta Distribution of the second kind. Check that both methods produce exactly the same distribution’s estimate. - Do the same using a Monte Carlo experiment and compare the outcome with the Bootstrap estimate (control the seed). The jackknife (Quenouille (1956), Tukey (1958)) was a first step toward simulation-based inference, developed to compute standard errors. It actually produces \\(n\\) systematic (not randomly drawn) samples \\(F_{(i)}^{(n)},i=1,\\ldots,n\\), each one of size \\(n-1\\), obtained by successively removing one observation at the time. For the functional \\(\\hat{\\theta}(F^{(n)})\\), the (unbiased) Jackknife standard error (SE), say \\(T\\), is given by (see Efron and Stein (1981)) \\[\\begin{equation} T(\\hat{\\theta})=\\left[\\frac{n-1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\hat{\\theta}\\left(F_{(i)}^{(n)}\\right)-\\bar{\\hat{\\theta}}\\right)\\right]^{1/2} \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\bar{\\hat{\\theta}}=1/n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\hat{\\theta}\\left(F_{(i)}^{(n)}\\right)\\). The jackknife can be seen as a linear approximation of the bootstrap, hence less appropriate for unsmooth estimators (e.g. quantiles). Exercise (optional) - Use the sample experimental setting as in the exercise for the Boostrap and compute the sampling distribution estimate of of the Theil Inequality Index using the jacknife. Compare the results with the ones based on the Bootsrap and Monte Carlo simulations. An alternative and natural estimator for \\(F\\) is to assume that \\(F\\) belongs to a family of (parametric) distributions (models), indexed by a parameter vector \\(\\theta\\), i.e. the set \\(\\{F_{\\theta}, \\theta\\in\\Theta\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^p \\}\\) and, using the plug-in principle, one gets \\(\\hat{F}=F_{\\hat{\\theta}}\\). This requires some attention for the choice of \\(\\hat{\\theta}\\) which ad minima should be consistent. The MLE (computed on the original sample \\(F^{(n)}\\)) is a suitable candidate for consistency, but also for efficiency. To produce \\(B\\) samples of size \\(n\\), there exists various (implemented) random generators, which are in principle based on a random generation of Uniform(0,1) realizations \\(u_i,\\ldots,u_n\\), from which a sample is obtained via \\(x_i=F_{\\hat{\\theta}}^{-1}(u_i), i=1,\\ldots,n\\). Parametric families act as regularizers, smoothing out the raw data and de-emphasizing extreme observations. They are particularly appreciated when studying rare events, like probabilities of extremes, in finance, insurance and with natural phenomena (tides, temperatures, earthquakes, etc.). The obvious drawback is that they need to be specified a priori, but the family can be sufficiently large. In this case, model selection becomes an important step into model building, with an obvious impact on inference. Exercise (optional): There are different ways to simulate samples in the linear regression model case. In the non parametric case, the design matrix is kept fixed or, alternatively, the raws are drawn together with the response. It is not yet clear which method is the most suitable in therms of statistical properties of resulting procedures like significance testing. In the parametric case, only the random part is simulated, i.e. the residuals (with \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\sigma}\\)). There is also a semi-parametric version which consists in resampling the residuals. - With the Malnutrition in Zambia dataset, considering the (complete) linear model without interactions, compute 95% confidence intervals (percentile method) for the slope parameter of the breastfeeding duration variable, using the four different resampling schemes for the linear regression model. Compare. Hint: Read chapter 11 of Efron and Hastie (2016). 1.6.5 Model Selection Model selection is a broad concept. For example, for a family of models \\(F_{\\mathbf{\\theta}}\\), there exists an (almost) infinite number of different ones according to the value of \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}\\). Hence, estimation (parametric or non parametric) is also a form of model selection since it allows, from the sample, to reduce the set of potential models. Another form of model selection involves, simultaneously, the specification of the parameter’s set \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}\\) (e.g. what is \\(p\\)) and, within this specification, a reduced set of potential values. This process, like estimation, is by nature inferential, since the only available information is the sample. A trade-off needs then to be made between the model complexity (e.g. \\(p\\)) and the model adequacy (e.g. its fit to the data). The choice of the measure associated to the trade-off is also important. While model adequacy is an obvious objective to achieve, reducing model complexity is a more subtle, but also an important feature. The reasons include (see also James et al. (2013), Section 2.1.3): When we are mainly interested in inference, then restrictive models are much more interpretable. When the objective is prediction only and the interpretability of the predictive model is simply not of interest, we might expect that it will be best to use the most flexible model available. Surprisingly, this is not always the case, since more accurate predictions are obtained using a less complex models (see Section 2.1) One can separate model selection procedures in three broad categories which are: - Subset Selection: This approach involves identifying a subset of the \\(p\\) predictors (i.e. a non zero subset of \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}\\)) that we believe to be related to the response. - Shrinkage: This approach involves fitting a model involving all \\(p\\) predictors (or parameters in \\(\\mathbf{\\theta}\\)). However, the estimated parameters are shrunk towards zero relative in the estimation procedure. This shrinkage is also known as regularization and has the effect of reducing sampling error and, depending on what type of shrinkage is performed, some of the coefficients may be estimated to be exactly zero, leading to a form of subset selection. - Dimension Reduction: This approach involves reducing the \\(p\\) predictors into a \\(q\\)-dimensional subspace, where \\(q &lt;p\\), using a trade-off between information loss due to the dimension reduction and model complexity. The \\(q\\) (orthogonal) axes of the subspace are then used as predictors to fit the model. Obviously, subset selection and shrinkage are methods that target the model interpretability objective, while dimension reduction might be more appropriate for pure prediction. It is however not clear that, in terms of out-of-sample prediction error, one set of approaches is better than the others. In this course we will mainly focus on subset selection while also presenting shrinkage methods. References "],

This also includes being able to predict future outcomes and to assess research hypotheses within the population. Therefore, to reach these objectives, the available information should be used for two important tasks: building the model (learning phase) assess its out-of-sample validity The two tasks are interdependent since building the model, i.e. finding the most suitable one, is made by optimizing, in some sense, its out-of-sample validity. Out-of-sample validity is a crucial concept in model selection. Indeed, it allows to assess how the results of a statistical analysis (e.g. the selection of a model) will generalize to other outcomes, equivalently, to the population. Without out-of-sample validation, a selection procedure will necessarily tend to choose models that overfit the data, since they would be the best within the sample. In other words, when overfitting, a model describes random error or noise instead of the underlying relationship, leading to an excessively complex model (too many parameters relative to the number of observations) and consequently a poor predictive performance and a wrong representation of what happens in the population. Example of overfitting situation # Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting. # Noisy (roughly linear) data is fitted to a linear function and a polynomial function. # Although the polynomial function is a perfect fit, the linear function can be expected # to generalize better: if the two functions were used to extrapolate beyond the fit data, # the linear function would make better predictions. This is because the polynomial # function it is too dependent on the data which contains sampling error. # knitr::include_graphics(&quot;Figures/OverfitEx1.png&quot;) More formally, consider a random variable \\(Y\\) distributed according to model \\(F_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\), possibly conditionally on a set of fixed covariates \\(\\mathbf{X}=[x_1 \\ldots \\, x_p]\\). We observe a random sample \\(\\mathbf{y} = (Y_i)_{i = 1, \\ldots , n}\\) supposedly generated from \\(F_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\) together with a non-random \\(n\\times p\\) full rank matrix of predictors \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). Define the prediction function \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) that depends on the considered model, for example \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\mathbf{x}\\) for the linear regression model. The inferential task is to assess the accuracy of the prediction function, so that it can be compared to alternative prediction functions. Quantifying the prediction error of a prediction function requires specification of a discrepancy \\(D\\) between a prediction \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) and the actual response \\(\\mathbf{y}\\). A natural choice is the mean squared error (mean residual squared error) \\[\\begin{equation} D\\left(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}},\\mathbf{y}\\right)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nd\\left(\\hat{y}_i,y_i\\right)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\right)^2 \\end{equation}\\] However, in order to avoid overfitting situations for out-of-sample validity, what is actually sought is the true prediction error, i.e. the (mathematically) expected discrepancy between prediction function out-of-sample \\(\\hat{y}_0\\) and the corresponding out-of-sample realization \\(y_0\\), namely \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Err}=\\mathbb{E}_{0}\\left[d\\left(\\hat{Y}_0,Y_0\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbb{E}_{0}\\) denotes the expectation at the out-of-sample distribution. This quantity needs to be estimated in some manner with the sample at hand, hence the real challenge in model selection is - the specification of an out-of-sample validity measure, called a model selection criterion - estimators for model selection criteria - performance measures to compare different model selection criteria In the following sections we present several methods for model selection and measures for out-of-sample validity. Exercice (optional): - Consider the Malnutrition in Zambia dataset (without interections). As model fit assesment consider a) the residual variance and b) the R^2. Starting from the full model (without interactions), increase progressively model size by including polynomials (on the continuous variables) and observe the behavior of the model fit criteria (using e.g. a plot). Additional material: Controlling for out-of-sample validity follows the lines of the scientific approach, in particular Occam’s razor problem-solving principle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam's_razor). One can intuitively understand overfitting from the fact that information from all past experience can be divided into two groups: information that is relevant for the future (“signal”) and irrelevant information (“noise”). Everything else being equal, the more difficult a criterion is to predict (i.e., the higher its uncertainty), the more noise existing in past information needs to be ignored. The problem is to determine which part to ignore. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting. 2.2 Cross-Validation The challenge is now to find a suitable estimator for \\(\\text{Err}\\) with the help of the sample and the (assumed) model \\(F_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\). A first guess is the apparent error \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{err}= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^nd\\left(\\hat{y}_i,y_i\\right) \\end{equation}\\] Unfortunately err usually underestimates Err since \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) has been adjusted to fit the observed responses \\(y_i\\) (trainig set). Ideally, one should have an independent validation set (or test set) of say \\(n^{\\star}\\) additional observations \\(y_{0i}, i=1,\\ldots,n^{\\star}\\), so that one could estimate Err using \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\text{Err}}_{\\text{val}}= \\frac{1}{n^{\\star}}\\sum_{i=1}^{n^{\\star}}d\\left(\\hat{y}_{0i},y_{0i}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] Cross-validation attempts to mimic \\(\\widehat{\\text{Err}}_{\\text{val}}\\) without the need for a validation set. Define \\(\\hat{y}_{(i)}\\) to be the predicted value computed on the reduced training set in which the \\(i\\)th observation has been omitted. The the leave one out cross-validation estimate of prediction error is \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\text{Err}}_{\\text{cv1}}= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}d\\left(\\hat{y}_{(i)},y_{i}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] A more common practice is to leave out several observations at a time: the sample is randomly partitioned into \\(J\\) groups of size about \\(\\lfloor n/J\\rfloor=n_J\\) each, then for each \\(j=1,\\ldots,J\\) groups, the training set is the sample without the \\(j\\)th group on which the prediction \\(\\hat{y}_{(j)}\\) is computed and then compared to the observations in the \\(j\\)th group \\(y_j\\) using the chosen discrepancy measure \\(D\\). A common choice is \\(J=10\\) leading to the ten-fold cross-validation procedure. Reducing from \\(n\\) to \\(J\\) the number of training and validation sets reduces the necessary number of prediction rules constructions (estimation). The optimal value for \\(J\\) is however not known. Exercise: (solutions (4.2.1) provided by Alexander Maslev, Hanxiong Wang and Minyoung Lee). Program k-fold Cross-Validation (with k=2) and do model selection in a specific simulation setting with an exhaustive search. Follow these steps: Generate from a MVN (multivariate normal) a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X_{n*p}}\\) with \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 5\\). You can choose the location vector as you wish but set the scale matrix as the identity. Choose the generating vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta }= [3 \\; 1.5 \\; 0 \\; 2 \\; 0]\\) and retrieve the signal to noise ratio of this setting. Generate \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) thanks to the relation \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X_{n*p}} \\; \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) where \\(\\epsilon_{i}\\) is a standard normal, \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 5\\). Suppose for simplicity that the errors are uncorrelated. Split the data randomly in two halves (k=2) and use the training set to determine \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\). Then, compute the squared loss function as prediction error measure for each possible model. Observe which model is the best model. Suppose now that we increase the size of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) to 100 (i.e. \\(p = 100\\) ). Calculate the number of possible models to evaluate together with an estimate of the time needed for an exhaustive search (hint: use previous results). Conclude on the feasibility of this task. 2.3 Covariance Penalties Criteria 2.3.1 Introduction Originally, the covariance penalty approach treats prediction error estimation in a regression framework, with the predictors \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) considered as fixed. Moreover, supposing for the moment that the discrepancy measure is the squared difference (or \\(L_2\\) norm), the true prediction error (conditionally on \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\)) is defined as \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Err}_i=\\mathbb{E}_{0}\\left[\\left(\\hat{Y}_i-Y_0\\right)^2\\right] \\end{equation}\\] The overall prediction error is \\(\\text{Err}=1/n\\sum_{i=1}^n\\text{Err}_i\\). The question is how to estimate this quantity, given a sample and a data generating model? (Efron 2004) uses \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\text{Err}_i\\right]\\) (where \\(\\mathbb{E}\\) denotes the expectation at the insample distribution) and shows that \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\text{Err}_i\\right]= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\text{err}_i\\right]+2\\text{cov}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right) \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\text{err}_i= (Y_i-\\hat{Y}_i)^2\\), the apparent (or in-sample) error and \\(\\text{cov}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right)=\\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])\\right]\\). Proof (see Efron and Hastie (2016), p. 220): Let \\(\\delta_{1i}=Y_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i]\\) and \\(\\delta_{2i}=\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i]\\), we can write \\[\\begin{eqnarray} (Y_i-\\hat{Y}_i)^2&amp;=&amp;(\\delta_{1i}-\\delta_{2i})^2=\\delta^2_{1i}-2\\delta_{1i}\\delta_{2i}+\\delta_{2i}^2 \\\\ &amp;=&amp;(Y_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2-2(Y_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])+(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2 \\end{eqnarray}\\] We then have \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_i-\\hat{Y}_i)^2\\right]&amp;=&amp;\\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2\\right]-2\\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2\\right] \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sigma^2 -2\\mbox{cov}\\left(Y_i,\\hat{Y}_i\\right)+\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2\\right] \\end{eqnarray}\\] from which we deduce that \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2\\right]=\\mathbb{E}[\\text{err}_i]+2\\mbox{cov}\\left(Y_i,\\hat{Y}_i\\right)-\\sigma^2\\). Likewise \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_{0i}-\\hat{Y}_i)^2\\right]&amp;=&amp;\\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_{0i}-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2\\right]-2\\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_{0i}-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])\\right]+\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2\\right] \\\\ \\end{eqnarray}\\] and because \\(\\hat{Y}_i\\) and \\(Y_{0i}\\) are independent, we get \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_{0i}-\\hat{Y}_i)^2\\right]&amp;=&amp; \\sigma^2 +\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2\\right] \\end{eqnarray}\\] Note that \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{E}_{0}\\left[(Y_{0i}-\\hat{Y}_i)^2\\right]\\right]=\\mathbb{E}_0\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left[(Y_{0i}-\\hat{Y}_i)^2\\right]\\right]\\), so that \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\text{Err}_i\\right]&amp;=&amp;\\sigma^2 +\\mathbb{E}\\left[(\\hat{Y}_i-\\mathbb{E}[Y_i])^2\\right] \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\mathbb{E}[\\text{err}_i]+2\\mbox{cov}\\left(Y_i,\\hat{Y}_i\\right) \\end{eqnarray}\\] This result says that, on average, the apparent error \\(\\text{err}_i\\) underestimates the true prediction error \\(\\text{Err}_i\\) by the covariance penalty \\(2\\text{cov}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right)\\). This makes intuitive sense since \\(\\text{cov}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right)\\) measures the amount by which \\(Y_i\\) influences its own prediction \\(\\hat{Y}_i\\). An natural estimator for the overall prediction error is then given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\text{Err}}= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\right)^2+\\frac{2}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\widehat{\\text{cov}}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right) \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] Depending on the assumed model, \\(\\widehat{\\text{cov}}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right)\\) is obtained analytically up to a value of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\), the model’s parameters, which is then replaced by \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\) (plug-in method), or by resampling methods such as the parametric bootstrap. For the later, considering the model \\(F_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\), one uses the following steps: Estimate \\(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\) from \\(F^{(n)}\\) to get \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\). Set the seed For \\(j=1,\\ldots,B\\), do Simulate \\(n\\) values \\(y_i^{(j)}, i=1,\\ldots,n\\) from \\(F_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}}\\), Compute \\(\\hat{y}_i^{(j)}, i=1,\\ldots,n\\), possibly conditionally on the matrix of predictors \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) Compute \\(\\forall i\\) \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\text{cov}}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right)=1/B\\sum_{j=1}^B\\left(\\hat{y}_i^{(j)}-\\hat{y}_i^{(j\\cdot)}\\right)\\left(y_i^{(j)}-y_i^{(j\\cdot)}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\hat{y}_i^{(j\\cdot)}=1/n\\sum_{j=1}^B\\hat{y}_i^{(j)}\\) and \\(y_i^{(j\\cdot)}=1/n\\sum_{j=1}^By_i^{(j)}\\) Exercise (optional): Consider the simulation setting of the exercise in the previous Section. - Instead of splitting the sample in two halves, compute the covariance prenalized predition error, with covariance penalty estimated via simulations (using the proposed algorithm). - Compare the analysis (decison) with the one obtained by means of cross-validation (in the previous exercise). 2.3.2 Mallows \\(C_p\\) Consider the linear regression model \\(Y_i|\\mathbf{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_i\\right),\\sigma^2), 0&lt;\\sigma^2&lt;\\infty\\), with \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_i\\right)=\\mathbf{x}_i^T \\boldsymbol{\\beta}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) and \\(\\mathbf{x}_i^T\\) is the ith row of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) (that includes a column of ones for the intercept). One notable result (see exercise below) that can be deduced from the covariance penalty formula, for the linear regression model using the least squares estimator (LSE) \\(\\hat{\\beta}=\\left(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}\\), \\(\\mathbf{y}=[y_1,\\ldots,y_n]^T\\), is Mallow’s \\(C_p\\)3 (Mallows 1973): \\[\\begin{equation} C_p=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\right)^2+\\frac{2}{n}p\\sigma^2 \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] Exercise: derive Mallow’s \\(C_p\\) from \\(\\text{Err}\\). (2.2) is a special case of (2.1) if \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\text{cov}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right)=p\\sigma^2\\). We can make use of the trace operator (see trace) to write \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{i=1}^n\\text{cov}\\left(\\hat{Y}_i;Y_i\\right) = \\mbox{tr}\\left(\\mbox{cov}(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}},\\mathbf{Y})\\right) \\end{equation}\\] Since \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}} = \\mathbf{H}\\boldsymbol{Y}\\), with \\(\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\) is the least squares projection matrix (or hat matrix) of trace \\(p\\), we can then write \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\mbox{tr}\\left(\\mbox{cov}(\\hat{\\mathbf{Y}},\\mathbf{Y})\\right) &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{tr}\\left( \\mbox{cov}(\\mathbf{HY},\\mathbf{Y})\\right)\\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\mbox{tr}\\left( \\mathbf{H}\\mbox{cov}(\\mathbf{Y},\\mathbf{Y})\\right) = \\mbox{tr}\\left(\\mathbf{H} \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}\\right) \\\\ &amp;=&amp; \\sigma^2 \\mbox{tr}\\left(\\mathbf{H}\\right) = \\sigma^2 p \\end{eqnarray}\\] q.e.d. Note that (2.2) cannot be used in a real situation since the value of \\(\\sigma^2\\) is unknown. In practice, \\(\\sigma^2\\) is replaced by \\(\\hat{\\sigma}^2\\) suitabily chosen. For that, there is no optimal choice and what is usually preferred is the residual variance estimator at the full or maximal model. When \\(n&lt;p\\), the choice is still an open question… Exercise (optional): Consider a Linear Mixed Model (LMM), for example the electrode resistance data, estimated using the generalized least squares (GLS) estimator. - Derive and/or estimate \\(\\widehat{\\text{Err}}\\). Hint: write the model with a vector of stacked responses and, consequently, a non-diagonal residual error (co)variance. 2.3.3 Efron’s \\(q\\)-class Covariance penalties can be applied to measures of prediction error other than squared error, like the Kullback - Leibler divergence. Then, to derive \\(\\widehat{\\text{Err}}\\), one needs a more general expression for \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\text{Err}_i\\right]\\). B. Efron (1986a) uses a function \\(Q(\\cdot,\\cdot)\\) based on the \\(q\\)-class error measure between two scalar functions \\(u\\) and \\(v\\), given by \\[\\begin{equation} Q(u,v) = q(v) + \\dot{q}(v) (u - v) - q(u) \\tag{2.3} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\dot{q}(v)\\) is the derivative of \\(q( \\cdot )\\) evaluated at \\(v\\). For example \\(q(v) = v(1-v)\\) gives the squared loss function \\(Q(u,v) = (u - v)^2\\) and \\(q(v)=\\min\\{v,(1-v)\\}\\) leads to the missclassification loss \\(Q(u,v)=I\\{u\\neq I(u&gt;1/2)\\}\\), where \\(I(\\cdot)\\) denotes the indicator function. Efron’s optimism Theorem (Efron 2004) demonstrates that \\[\\begin{equation*} \\text{Err}_i = \\mathbb{E} \\left[ \\mathbb{E}_0 \\left[ Q(Y^0_i,\\hat{Y}_i) | \\mathbf{y}\\right] \\right] =\\mathbb{E} \\left[ Q(Y_i,\\hat{Y}_i) + \\Omega_i \\right] \\label{eq:optimismTHM} \\end{equation*}\\] with \\(\\Omega_i = \\text{cov} \\left( \\dot{q}(\\hat{Y}_i),Y_i \\right)\\). Hence, an estimator of \\(\\text{Err}\\) is obtained as \\[\\begin{equation} \\widehat{\\text{Err}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\\left( Q(y_i,\\hat{y}_i) + \\widehat{\\text{cov}} \\left( \\dot{q}(\\hat{Y}_i),Y_i \\right)\\right) \\end{equation}\\] Exercise: - Verify that by setting \\(q(v)=\\min\\{v,(1-v)\\}\\) one gets \\(Q(u,v)=I\\{u\\neq I(u&gt;1/2)\\}\\). 2.4 Information Theory and Bayesian Criteria 2.4.1 AIC: Akaike Information Criterion The AIC is derived from Information Theory which concerns the quantification, storage, and communication of information (Shannon (1948a),Shannon (1948b)). Associated measures are applied to distributions of random variables and include the entropy measure for a single random variable. A derived measure for two random variables is the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or information divergence, information gain, or relative entropy). Consider two densities \\(f_0\\) and \\(f_1\\), the Kullback–Leibler divergence is \\[\\begin{equation} D\\left(f_0,f_1\\right)=2\\int f_0(y) \\log\\left(\\frac{f_0(y)}{f_1(y)}\\right)dy = 2\\mathbb{E}_0\\left[\\log\\left(\\frac{f_0(y)}{f_1(y)}\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\\] The Kullback-Leibler divergence can be used to evaluate the adequacy of a model, by considering e.g. \\(f_1:=f(y;\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})\\), the fitted density corresponding to model \\(F_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\). In that case, the true prediction error becomes a deviance given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Err}_i=2\\mathbb{E}_0\\left[\\log\\left(\\frac{f_0(y)}{f(y_i;\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})}\\right)\\right] \\end{equation}\\] with total deviance \\(1/n\\sum_{i=1}^n \\text{Err}_i\\). Akaike (Akaike 1974) proposed to consider, as a model adequacy measure, an estimator of \\[\\begin{equation} 2\\mathbb{E}_0\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\log\\left(f_0(y)\\right)-\\log\\left(f(y;\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})\\right)\\right]\\right] \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mathbb{E}\\) denotes the expectation at the insample distribution. Akaike derived the estimator \\[\\begin{equation} -2\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log f(\\hat{y}_i;\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}})+2p + \\text{const.} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\text{const.}\\) does not depend on the model and hence can be omitted when comparing models. For the linear regression model with \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}=\\mathbf{x}^T \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\), supposing \\(\\sigma^2\\) known (and omitting the constant term), we have \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(y_i-\\mathbf{x}_i^T \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\right)^2+2p \\end{equation}\\] There exist several expressions for the AIC for the linear regression model, one of them being \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{AIC}= \\frac{1}{n\\sigma^2} \\text{RSS}+\\frac{2}{n}p \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\text{RSS}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y_i-\\mathbf{x}_i^T \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\right)^2\\) is the residual sum-of-squares. We can see that \\(C_p=\\sigma^2\\text{AIC}\\). Exercise (solutions (4.2.2) provided by Alexander Maslev, Hanxiong Wang and Minyoung Lee). Derive the AIC for the regression model from its more general definition. (optional) Program AIC and do model selection in a specific simulation setting with an exhaustive search (follow the passages listed in the CV exercise section). Compare the performance of your programmed CV and AIC by replicating 100 times the tasks. In particular you should evaluate three specific criteria: the proportion of times the correct model is selected (Exact), the proportion of times the selected model contains the correct one (Correct) and the average number of selected regressors (Average \\(\\sharp\\)) In the same simulation setting outlined in the CV exercise section, generate from a MVN (multivariate normal) a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X_{n*p}}\\) with \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 5\\) but now fix the scale matrix with an autoregressive form \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}=[\\sigma_{lm}]_{l,m=1,\\ldots,p}\\) with \\(\\sigma_{lm} = \\rho^{\\mid l - m\\mid}\\). Compare the performance of CV and AIC for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\rho} = [0.2 \\; 0.5\\; 0.7]\\) (\\(\\rho = 0\\) corresponds to the identity case that you have already treated). Upload the Zambia dataset and perform an exhaustive search on the continuous covariates (i.e. avoiding factors) based on CV and AIC in order to find the best model. You can either employ your codes derived in previous exercises or make use of the existing R packages: leaps, glmulti, MuMIn and caret. Exercise (optional): Using the general result on covariance penalty measures based on Efron’s \\(q\\)-class, show that the AIC is a suitable estimator of the prediction error. 2.4.2 BIC: Bayesian Information Criterion (Schwarz 1978) derived the Bayesian information criterion as \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{BIC} = -\\sum_{i=1}^n \\log f(\\hat{y}_i;\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}},\\hat{\\sigma}^2)+p\\log(n) + \\text{const.} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\log(n)\\) is the natural logarithm of n and \\(\\text{const.}\\) does not depend on the model; hence can be omitted when comparing models. The BIC is derived from Bayesian inference arguments, but is not related to information theory. Compared to the AIC (or indeed the \\(C_p\\)), the BIC uses \\(p\\log(n)\\) instead of \\(2p\\) as an estimated penalty and since \\(\\log(n)&gt; 2\\) for any \\(n &gt; 7\\), the BIC statistic generally places a heavier penalty on models with many variables, and hence results in the selection of smaller models than AIC. 2.5 Mean Squared Error Based Criteria 2.5.1 Stein’s unbiased risk estimator (SURE) Stein (1981) derived an unbiased estimator of the mean-squared error of “a nearly arbitrary, nonlinear biased estimator”, hence providing an indication of the accuracy of a given estimator. Namely, consider the normal setting with \\(Y\\vert \\mathbf{X} \\sim \\cal{N}\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\mathbf{X}),\\sigma^2\\right)\\) with a differentiable estimator \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}:=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(Y,\\mathbf{X})\\), Stein (1981) proposed an unbiased estimator of \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\vert\\vert \\boldsymbol{\\mu}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}\\vert\\vert_2^2\\right]\\) (MSE), given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{SURE}=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\right)^2+2\\sigma^2\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial\\hat{\\mu}_i}{\\partial y_i}-n\\sigma^2 \\end{equation}\\] Actually, for \\(Z\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\), it can be shown that \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[Zf(Z)\\right]=\\sigma^2\\mathbb{E}\\left[f^{&#39;}(Z)\\right]\\) (Stein 1981), so that \\(\\sigma^2\\sum_{i=1}^n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\partial\\hat{\\mu}_i/\\partial Y_i\\right]=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\text{cov}\\left(Y_i,\\hat{Y}_i\\right)\\). This implies that, in the covariance penalty framework of Section 2.3, for the normal model, \\(\\sigma^2\\sum_{i=1}^n \\partial\\hat{\\mu}_i/\\partial y_i\\) is a suitable estimator of \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\text{cov}\\left(Y_i,\\hat{Y}_i\\right)\\). For the linear model with \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}=\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) and considering the OLS, \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}=\\mathbf{X}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{^-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}\\), we have \\(\\partial\\hat{\\mu}_i/\\partial y_i=\\mathbf{x}_i(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{^-1}\\mathbf{x}_i^T\\), and hence the SURE is not equal to the \\(C_p\\). It is however more general, i.e. for any differentiable estimator \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}\\) of \\(Y\\), and hence useful in nonparametric regression (see e.g. Donoho and Johnstone (1995)) Exercise: show that for \\(Z\\sim N(0,\\sigma^2)\\), \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[Zf(Z)\\right]=\\sigma^2\\mathbb{E}\\left[f^{&#39;}(Z)\\right]\\) 2.5.2 The Focused Information Criterion (FIC) The FIC in its original format (see Claeskens and Hjort (2003)) interprets best model in the sense of minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimator of the quantity of interest. The FIC philosophy puts less emphasis on which variables are in the model but rather on the accuracy of the estimator of a focus. To build the FIC, one considers a model of the form \\(F_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}, \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}\\), with density \\(f(\\cdot;\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})\\), with \\(\\boldsymbol{\\nu} \\in \\mathbb{R}^p\\) not subject to model selection (i.e. included in all considered models), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma} \\in \\mathbb{R}^q\\) the parameters on which model selection is performed. \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\) and \\(q\\) are allowed to depend on the sample size \\(n\\), hence \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}:= \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{n}\\) and \\(q:= q_n\\). For the linear regression model \\(Y_i|\\mathbf{x}_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\beta_0+\\mathbf{x}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta},\\sigma^2)\\)(with \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\) not containing the one in the first column), a natural choice is \\(\\boldsymbol{\\nu} = (\\beta_0,\\sigma^2)\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_n = \\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\). The focus, or quantity of interest, is \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}:=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_n)\\), which can be, but not necessarily, the prediction for one particular new observation. Given a (chosen) estimator for the focus, \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}:=\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}_n)\\), assuming \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_n= \\boldsymbol{\\gamma} + \\boldsymbol{\\delta}/\\sqrt{n}\\) and considering a fixed value \\(q\\), Claeskens and Hjort (2003) use a Taylor expansion of \\(\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\right)\\) to derive the bias and variance to build the (first order) MSE. More specifically, consider the set of indices \\(S\\subseteq \\left\\{1,\\ldots,q\\right\\}\\) such that \\(\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_S\\subseteq \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\) is the corresponding subset of parameters, hence forming a submodel \\(S\\) of \\(F_{\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}\\), one gets \\[\\begin{equation} \\sqrt{n}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_S-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\right)\\approx \\left[\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}\\right]^T\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\nu}}-\\boldsymbol{\\nu}\\right)+ \\left[ \\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_S} \\right]^T\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}_S-\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}\\right)-\\frac{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\boldsymbol{\\nu},\\boldsymbol{\\gamma})}{\\partial\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}}\\boldsymbol{\\delta} \\end{equation}\\] To derive the MSE (of \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_S\\)), Claeskens and Hjort (2003) use the asymptotic distribution of \\(\\sqrt{n}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_S-\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\right)\\). Project: - For the Malnutrition in Zambia dataset, considering the breastfeeding duration as the most important variable, develop an estimator for the FIC, build a model that optimizes the FIC and compare the resulting model with the one obtained with other methods. 2.6 Classification measures When model building is about predicting binary outcome, like for example the success (or not) of a treatment in medical research, one enters in the world of classification. We are concerned here in supervised classification, i.e. the exercise of building a classifier from a dataset containing the outcome (response) variable. When the outcome variable is not available, the exercise is referred to as unsupervised classification (or clustering). In a model building framework, the obvious model for binary classification is the logistic regression, a member of the family of generalized linear models (GLM). In this setting, prediction error becomes classification error and as it will be seeing below, there is no unique and natural measure, which imply that assessing the validity of the model (i.e. the classification rule) is not a straightforward task. Indeed, the nature of the problem can make classical prediction error measures rather useless. For example, suppose that the objective is to build a logistic model to classify patients into two groups, the ones with a serious disease and the other healthy ones. Most often, the collected data will contain a large majority of healthy patients (representing what happens in the population), say 95%, so that a good classifier (that is difficult to beat), is the one that predicts ALL patients as healthy. In that case, the classification error as measured by a prediction criterion would be of only 5%. Hence, other criteria need to be considered when assessing the validity of a classifier (model). 2.6.1 The logistic model The logistic model links, through the Bernoulli distribution, the outcome variable (response) \\(Y\\) and the linear predictor \\(\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\), \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) being an \\(n\\times p\\) matrix of fixed covariates with row \\(\\mathbf{x}_i,i=1,\\ldots,n\\), by means of \\(Y_i\\vert \\mathbf{x}_i \\sim_{iid} B(\\pi_i)\\), with \\(\\pi_i=\\mathbb{E}[Y_i]=P(Y_i=1)=\\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta})/(1+\\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta}))\\) (logistic link). An estimator for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) with score functions \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\vert \\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})=\\sum_{i=1}^n\\mathbf{x}^T_iy_i- \\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta})}{1+\\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i\\boldsymbol{\\beta})}\\mathbf{x}^T_i \\end{equation}\\] so that \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}=\\mbox{argzero}_{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\mathbf{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\vert \\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})\\) which has no closed form. In high dimensions, this feature adds numerical difficulties compared to the linear regression model. Indeed, a popular algorithm for finding \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) is the iteratively reweighted least squares with iterative \\(k\\)th step given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^{k}\\equiv \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^{k-1}+\\mathbf{J}^{-1}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^{k-1}\\right)\\mathbf{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\vert \\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y}) \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\mathbf{J}\\left(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\right)\\) being the negative of the Hessian matrix (partial derivative of \\(\\mathbf{S}(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\vert \\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})\\) with respect to \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\)) that depends on the current value of \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\), hence requiring numerous inversions of high dimensional matrices. 2.6.2 Prediction error measures for Binary classification Before considering a prediction error measure, one should define a prediction measure for the logistic model. There are two common measures: - The fitted probabilities: \\(\\hat{\\pi}_i=\\widehat{\\mathbb{E}[Y_i]}=\\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})/(1+\\exp(\\mathbf{x}_i\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}))\\) - The predicted outcome: \\(I\\left(\\hat{\\pi}_i\\geq c\\right)\\) with \\(I\\left(\\right)\\) being the indicator function and \\(c\\) a chosen threshold with a priori \\(c=0.5\\). A classification error then builds, in general, upon \\(\\left(y_i-\\hat{\\pi}_i\\right)\\) or \\(\\left(y_i-I\\left(\\hat{\\pi}_i\\geq c\\right)\\right)\\). Popular measures include: The quadratic error: \\(\\Vert \\mathbf{y}-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}(\\mathbf{X})\\Vert_2\\) with \\(\\mathbf{y}=[y_i]_{i=1,\\ldots,n}\\), \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}(\\mathbf{X})=[\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)]_{i=1,\\ldots,n}\\) and \\(\\Vert \\cdot \\Vert_2\\) denoting the \\(L2\\)-norm. The misclassification error or Hamming distance: \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n(y_i-I\\left(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\geq c\\right))^2\\). The Binomial deviance (or cross-entropy): \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(y_i\\log(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i))-(1-y_i)\\log(1-\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i))\\right)\\). The hinge loss (or support vector machines, Vapnik (1996)): \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n \\max\\left(1−(2y_i −1)\\mbox{sign}(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i) −c), 0\\right)\\), with \\(c=0.5\\). The exponential loss (from the AdaBoost algorithm in generalized additive models, Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009)): \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\exp\\left(-(2y_i-1)\\mathbf{x}_i\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\right)\\). The Hamming distance does not really predict above (below) the threshold \\(c\\), since they are the same for say \\(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)=0.6\\) and \\(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)=0.9\\) with \\(c=0.5\\). There is therefore an information loss. In general, the (total) deviance for a model with estimates \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\mathbf{X}) =\\widehat{\\mathbb{E}}\\left[ \\mathbf{Y} \\vert \\mathbf{X},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\right]\\) may be constructed by its likelihood function as \\[\\begin{equation} D \\left( \\mathbf{Y} , \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\mathbf{X}) \\right) = 2 \\left( \\log P ( \\mathbf{Y} \\vert \\mathbf{X},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^s ) − \\log (P (\\mathbf{Y} \\vert \\mathbf{X},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} ) \\right) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^s\\) denotes the fitted parameters for the saturated model, i.e. with a parameter for every observation so that the data are fitted exactly. Hence, \\(P ( \\mathbf{Y} \\vert \\mathbf{X},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^s )=\\mathbf{1}\\) so that \\(\\log P ( \\mathbf{Y} \\vert \\mathbf{X},\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^s )=\\mathbf{0}\\) and for the logistic model with \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}(\\mathbf{X})=\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}(\\mathbf{X})\\), \\(D \\left( \\mathbf{Y} , \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}} (\\mathbf{X})\\right)\\) becomes the Binomial deviance. The hinge and exponential loss functions are particular cases of a general loss function used in machine learning: for binary outcomes \\(y_i^{\\star}=2y_i-1\\) taking the values \\(-1\\) or \\(1\\) and a prediction function \\(\\hat{\\mu}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\), a general loss function is \\(V\\left(y_i^{\\star},\\hat{\\mu}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)\\right)=\\phi(-y_i^{\\star}\\hat{\\mu}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i))\\). The hinge loss uses \\(\\hat{\\mu}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)=\\mbox{sign}(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i) −c)\\), hence is based on the fitted probabilities, while the exponential loss uses \\(\\hat{\\mu}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)=\\mathbf{x}_i\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\). Note that \\(\\mathbf{x}_i\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}=\\log\\left(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i)/(1-\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_i))\\right)\\) A comparison between different classification error measures (loss functions) can be found in Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009), Section 10.6. 2.6.3 Classification error estimation Efron’s optimism Theorem (Efron 2004) can also be used to obtain an estimator of the out-of-sample classification error, at least up to \\(\\widehat{\\text{cov}} \\left( \\dot{q}(\\hat{\\mu}_i),Y_i \\right)\\), with the appropriately chosen prediction function \\(\\hat{\\mu}_i\\). Exercise: - Show that when \\(q(v) = v(1-v)\\) in (2.3), one obtains for the loss function the quadratic error. - Show that when \\(q(v)=\\min\\{v,(1-v)\\}\\) in (2.3), one obtains for the loss function the misclassification error. - Show that when \\(q(v)= -2[v \\log(v) + (1-v)\\log(1-v)]\\) in (2.3), one obtains for the loss function the binomial deviance or twice the Kullback-Leibler divergence. - Show that when \\(q(v)=2\\min\\{v,(1-v)\\}\\) in (2.3), one obtains for the loss function the hinge loss. - Show that when \\(q(v)=2\\sqrt{v,(1-v)}\\) in (2.3), one obtains for the loss function the exponential loss. Deriving \\(\\text{cov} \\left( \\dot{q}(\\hat{\\mu}_i),Y_i \\right)\\) analytically and estimating it by then plugging in parameter’s estimates is not a straightforward task. Approximations provided in Efron (1978) and B. Efron (1986b) can be used. Alternatively, one can rely on simulation based (bootstrap) estimation of the covariance, as is done in Efron (2004), but in high dimensions, the computational cost could be prohibitive. Ecercise (optional): - Derive \\(\\text{cov} \\left( \\dot{q}(\\hat{\\mu}_i),Y_i \\right)\\) for the quadratic error, using a Efron’s approximation \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\Sigma^{-1} \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\), with \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{x}_{i}y_{i}\\) and \\(\\Sigma=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\pi_{i} (1-\\pi_{i})\\), \\(\\mathbf{x}_{i} \\mathbf{x}_{i}^{T}\\) and also using first order Taylor expansions. 2.6.4 The ROC curve The receiver operating characteristic curve, i.e. ROC curve, is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold is varied. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. Indeed, with binary classification, supposing two possible outcomes denoted as positive, respectively, negative, there are four possible classification outcomes: - True positive (TP): the outcome is positive and correctly predicted as positive. - False positive (FP) occurs when the outcome is negative and predicted as positive. - True negative (TN): the outcome is negative and predicted as negative. - False negative (FN) occurs when the outcome is positive and predicted as negative. The corresponding rates are the probability (proportion) of occurrences that are correctly identified as such. For example, the TPR is the probability of positive prediction given that true state is positive, or in other words, the proportion of positive predictions among all positive outcomes. The rates are estimated from the sample for a selected model (classifier). The TPR is also known as sensitivity and the TNR as the specificity (the probability of negative prediction given that the true state is negative). Sensitivity therefore quantifies the avoiding of FN, and specificity does the same for FP. There is actually a trade-off between the measures like with hypothesis testing and the associated two error-types. This trade-off can be represented graphically using the ROC curve which plots 1 - specificity versus sensitivity. These measures and representations are widely used in medical sciences, where, ideally, a perfect model (classifier) would be described as 100% sensitive, meaning e.g. all sick individuals are correctly identified as sick, and 100% specific, meaning no healthy individuals are incorrectly identified as sick. Example: ROC curve and associated trade-off measures # Taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic. # # The ideal model (classifier) would reach the (0,100)% point. # knitr::include_graphics(&quot;Figures/ROC_curves.png&quot;) The ROC curve is mostly used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate a selected model (classifier). Indeed, in subset selection, a set of predictors (say \\(\\mathbf{X}_S\\)) are chosen and from which, using the logistic regression, fitted probabilities \\(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_{iS})\\) can be computed. The ROC curve is then computed by varying the threshold \\(c\\) in predicting outcomes using \\(\\hat{y}_i=I(\\hat{\\pi}_i(\\mathbf{x}_{iS})\\geq c)\\). Indeed, for different values of \\(c\\), the predictions \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) are different, hence leading to different measures for the sensitivity and the specificity. Conventionally, the sensitivity and specificity are computed at \\(c=0.5\\). Exercise (solutions presented in 4.2.3) Read the information on the Leukemia Dataset in the first chapter of the book. Then load the Leukemia dataset reduced which contains a subset of 11 eleven predictors among the 3571 present in the leukemia_small.csv. These variables have been selected, because of their importance, by the binary lasso which is a shrinkage method that will be discussed later on in the course. Now perform the following steps: (a) Fit the appropriate GLM for the situation using only one of the available predictors (e.g. V457) (b) Read the ROC curve section of the e-book. Then find the TPR (i.e. true positive rate), FPR (i.e. false positive rate), TNR (i.e. true negative rate), FNR (i.e. false negative rate) of the fitted values found at point (a) with a cut-off value \\(c = 0.5\\). (c) For a given cut-off grid of values, that you can choose as you wish, plot the ROC curve relative to the estimated model at point (a). (d) Check the quality of your result at point (c) with the R package pROC. Exercise (optional): - For a given selected model (classifier), using the logistic model and estimator \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\), express (formula) the estimated sensitivity and specificity as a function of the threshold \\(c\\). The area under the ROC is a scalar summary measure that is sometimes used as model validity. It is sometimes called the c-statistic. Alternative summary statistics include the Gini coefficient which corresponds to the area between the ROC curve and the no-discrimination line. However, for evaluating the contribution of an additional predictor when added to a standard model, any summary statistic associated to the ROC curve, like the the c-statistic, may not be an informative measure. The new predictor can be very significant in terms of the change in e.g. model deviance, but show only a small increase in the c-statistic (see Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009)).

One hence needs to find suitable methods for reducing the model size (number of predictors) by either: (a) ordering the predictors that enter the model sequentially, to constitute, at most, \\(p\\) potential models to be assessed and compared, (b) averaging groups of predictors. For (a), the ordering consists in a sequence of steps in which, starting from a null model (usually just the intercept), a covariate is chosen for addition to the current model based on some prespecified criterion. The sequence then stops when an overall criterion is met. For (b) averaging predictors is very popular in machine learning (supervised learning) and in this chapter we only review Classification And Regression Tree (CART). Obviously, the two approaches do not lead to the same type of chosen model. While stepwise methods lead to models that only include a subset of the available covariates, averaging methods use all the available covariates and group them in weighted averages. If the model is used to understand the underlying phenomenon, then stepwise methods are usually preferred. Exercise: Compare the number of models to be considered in an exhaustive approach to the ones considered in a stepwise forward approach. Choose \\(p=\\{5,10,15,20\\}\\) and suppose that the true (best) model has \\(p\\) and \\(p/2\\) predictors. 3.2 Stepwise forward regression Very generally, a forward stepwise regression follows the steps: 1. Let \\(\\cal{M}_0\\) denote the null model, which typically contains no predictors. 2. For \\(k = 1,\\ldots,p-1\\), do : (a) Consider all \\(p-k\\) models that augment the predictors in \\(\\mathcal{M}_k\\) with one additional predictor. (b) Choose the best among these \\(p-k\\) models, and call it \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\). 3. Stop the algorithm if \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k+1}\\) is not better than \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) and provide \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k}\\) as output. The algorithms differ in the definition of best in 2(b) and in the stopping rule criteria in 3. For the latter, it can be chosen among the criteria presented in Chapter 2. As an example, consider the \\(C_p\\) given in (2.2) as model selection criterion. We note that for fixed \\(p\\), i.e. when comparing models of the same size \\(p\\), the difference among the possible models that can be constructed is measured by the residual sum of squares \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n\\left(\\hat{y}_i-y_i\\right)^2\\). Hence, choosing the best model in 2(b) amounts at choosing the added covariate that most reduces the residual sum of squares of the augmented model. In a sequential framework, optimizing the choice of the covariate to add to the current model does not necessary lead to the best model of the current size since the optimization is done on the added covariate only. Additional properties need therefore to be considered. 3.2.1 Partial correlations The partial correlation between \\(X_j\\) and \\(Y\\) conditional of a set of \\(q\\) variables \\(\\mathbf{X} = \\{X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_q\\}, X_j\\notin \\mathbf{X}\\), written \\(\\hat{\\rho}_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}}\\), is the correlation between the residuals resulting from the linear regression of \\(X_j\\) on \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) and \\(Y\\) on \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). Namely, let \\(\\mathbf{X}_k\\), of size \\(n\\times q\\), and \\(\\mathbf{X}_{k+1}=[\\mathbf{x}_j]_{j=1,\\ldots,p-q}\\) be the matrices formed by the columns of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) (containing all the potential predictors) that are a) present at the current stepwise forward step for \\(\\mathbf{X}_k\\) and b) not present at the current stepwise forward step for \\(\\mathbf{X}_{k+1}\\). The partial correlations between each covariate \\(X_j\\) (corresponding to the columns of \\(\\mathbf{X}_{k+1}\\)) and the response vector \\(Y\\), given the set of \\(q\\) covariates corresponding to \\(\\mathbf{X}_k\\), can be written as \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\rho}_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_k}=\\frac{\\mathbf{e}^T(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{x}_j}{\\sqrt{\\left(\\mathbf{e}^T\\mathbf{e}\\right)\\left(\\mathbf{x}_j^T(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{x}_j\\right)}} \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\mathbf{e}=\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X}_k\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\), \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}=\\left(\\mathbf{X}_k^T\\mathbf{X}_k\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_k^T\\mathbf{y}\\), so that \\(\\mathbf{e}=\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{X}_k\\left(\\mathbf{X}_k^T\\mathbf{X}_k\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_k^T\\right)\\mathbf{y}=\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{H}\\right)\\mathbf{y}\\). The predictor \\(\\mathbf{X}_j\\) with the largest partial correlation offers the greatest reduction in the residual sum of squares; see e.g. Foster and Stine (2004). In high dimensional settings, the sweep operator (Goodnight 1979) can be used to obtain the partial correlations in a computationally fast manner. Exercise: - Prove that optimization problem (3.1) (i.e. min RSS at a given step) and (3.2) (i.e. max partial correlations) are equivalent: \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} &amp; \\underset{j \\in P\\backslash S}{\\text{min}} &amp; &amp; \\| \\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}^{\\star} \\hat{\\beta}^{\\star} - \\mathbf{x}_j \\beta_{j} \\|_{2}^{2} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} &amp; \\underset{j \\in P\\backslash S}{\\text{max}} &amp; &amp; \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{j}^{T} (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}^{\\star} \\hat{\\beta}^{\\star}) \\mid \\\\ \\end{aligned}\\tag{3.2} \\end{equation}\\] where: a) \\(P = \\{1,..,p\\}\\) is the set of all available predictors. b) \\(S = \\{a \\in P : \\; \\mid S \\mid = q\\}\\) is the solution set at the current step of the procedure. c) \\(\\mathbf{X}^{\\star}\\) is the \\(n \\;x\\; q\\) matrix of predictors selected at previous steps. d) \\(\\hat{\\beta}^{\\star}\\) is the OLS estimator of the model \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}^{\\star} {\\beta}^{\\star} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\). e) \\(\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\) is one of the \\(p - q\\) predictors left at the current step. Assume also that all the predictors have unitary norm (i.e. \\(\\mathbf{x}_{l}^{T}\\mathbf{x}_{l} = 1 \\; \\forall \\;l \\in P\\)). Exercise (optional): - Consider the Malnutrition in Zambia dataset and order the covariates according to their partial correlations using the R function fs of the Selective Inference R Package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/selectiveInference/index.html). - Compare the ordering with the one obtained by the lasso (LARS) and discuss why they are different. 3.2.2 Selection by hypothesis testing Partial correlations have been used in several instances to order the covariates in stepwise forward regression, combined with a stopping criterion based on a test statistic, like the \\(t\\)-test for significance testing. That is, the covariates are entered in the model using the partial correlation criterion (that is maximized) and the procedure stops when the \\(t\\)-test is not significant. However, with testing multiple hypothesis, one has to pay attention to the familywise error rate (FWER), i.e. the probability of making one or more false discoveries, or type I errors (rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true). This probability increases very rapidly with the number of hypothesis to be tested. Another concept is the false discovery rate (FDR) which is a measure that provides less stringent control of Type I errors compared to familywise error rate (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). FDR actually controls the expected proportion of discoveries (rejected null hypotheses) that are false (incorrect rejections). When all hypotheses are true, the FDR is equal to the FWER, and smaller otherwise. Hence, substantial power can be gained when testing multiple hypothesis, while controlling the FDR. Basically, one can see model selection (subset selection) as a series of hypothesis to be tested, namely significance testing associated to each potential slope \\(\\beta_j, j=1,\\ldots,p\\) at the full model. Because one cannot consider each test separately (FWER effect), what one actually seeks is to set the threshold \\(\\alpha\\) so that the proportion of false discoveries, i.e. the number of rejected hypothesis when they are true, is below this threshold. The proportion of false discovery is relative to the (unknown) number of \\(\\beta_j\\neq 0\\), it is hence given by the ratio \\[\\begin{equation} \\mbox{frd}=\\frac{V_p}{R_p(\\alpha)} \\end{equation}\\] with \\(V_p\\) the (unknown) number of false discoveries and \\(R_p(\\alpha)\\) the number of rejected hypothesis, among \\(p\\) hypothesis. frd is set to 0 when \\(R_p(\\alpha)=0\\). For the later, given a level \\(\\alpha\\), one can compute a \\(p\\)-value associated to each null hypothesis \\(\\mathbb{H}_{j0}:\\beta_j=0,j=1,\\ldots,p\\), say \\(p_j\\), so that \\(R_p(\\alpha)=\\sum_{j=1}^pI(p_j&gt;1-\\alpha)\\). The FRD is defined as the expected value of frd (over the \\(p\\)-values distribution), i.e. \\[\\begin{equation} \\mbox{FRD}=\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{V_p}{R_p(\\alpha)}\\right] \\end{equation}\\] If all \\(\\mathbb{H}_{j0}\\) are true, FDR is equivalent to FWER and in general controlling the FRD controls as well the FWER. In a sequential testing procedure in which the \\(p\\)-values \\(p_k,k=1,\\ldots p\\) (and associated null hypotheses) have been ordered in an ascending order, \\(\\mathbb{H}_{0j}, j=k,\\ldots,p\\) are rejected if \\(p_k&lt;\\alpha_k\\) with \\[\\alpha_k=\\alpha(k+1)/p.\\] With this rejection rule, the FDR (\\(\\leq\\alpha\\)) is controlled (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). Hence, in a stepwise procedure for variable selection, the search stops at step \\(k-1\\) if \\(p_k&gt;\\alpha_k\\), \\(p_k\\) being associated to the variable to enter at step \\(k\\). G’Sell et al. (2016) propose two other rules to find the cutoff when stopping the stepwise forward search, namely when stopping to reject the null hypothesis. Let \\(\\hat{k}\\) denote the last rejected null hypothesis (in the sequence), the rules are: - ForwardStop: \\(\\hat{k}_F=\\max\\left\\{k\\in\\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\vert-\\frac{1}{k}\\sum_{j=1}^k\\log\\left(1-p_j\\right)\\leq\\alpha\\right\\}\\) - StrongStop: \\(\\hat{k}_S=\\max\\left\\{k\\in\\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\vert \\exp\\left\\{\\sum_{j=k}^p\\frac{\\log\\left(p_j\\right)}{j}\\right\\}\\leq\\frac{k\\alpha}{p}\\right\\}\\) with \\(p_j\\) the \\(p\\)-value associated to \\(\\mathbb{H}_j\\) and by convention \\(\\hat{k}=0\\) whenever no rejections can be made. Both rules control the FDR at level \\(\\alpha\\). To order the covariates (hence the null hypotheses), one can use partial correlations, or, alternatively, as proposed in Lin, Foster, and Ungar (2011), to use \\(\\hat{\\gamma}_j\\), the least squares estimator of the model \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{e}=\\gamma_j\\mathbf{x}_j+\\tilde{\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] with \\(\\mathbf{e}=\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X}_k\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) is the least squares estimator of the model at step \\(k\\) (i.e. with \\(\\mathbf{X}_k\\)). Lin, Foster, and Ungar (2011) show that \\(\\hat{\\gamma}_j=\\rho^2\\hat{\\beta}_j\\), where \\(\\hat{\\beta}_j\\) is the least squares estimator of \\(\\beta_j\\) in the model with covariates matrix \\(\\left[\\mathbf{X}_k \\; \\mathbf{x}_j\\right]\\) and with \\[\\begin{equation} \\rho^2=\\mathbf{x}_j^T(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{x}_j \\end{equation}\\] and \\(\\mathbf{H}=\\mathbf{X}_k\\left(\\mathbf{X}_k^T\\mathbf{X}_k\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_k^T\\). \\(p\\)-values associated to \\(\\beta_j\\) (\\(\\forall j\\) corresponding to the columns of \\(\\mathbf{X}_{k+1}\\)) can be calculated without re-estimating each potential model at a given step and selection is made on the basis their size (in absolute value). Exercise : - First of all we retrieve the simulation setting used in Practical 3. Now, after having read the documentation of the R package selectiveInference and installed it, perform the following steps: a) Use the functions fs(), fsInf() and forwardStop() to do a stepwise regression based on partial correlations and a model selection phase with the ForwardStop rule on your generated data. Try different values for the type one error: how does the choice of \\(\\alpha\\) impact the model selection technique? b) Given the order of variables produced by fs(), use AIC and BIC criteria for model selection to retrieve your final model (Hint: you do not need to program them, use an existing function of the selectiveInference package). c) Calculate how many models are needed for an exhaustive search in this simulation setting. Use your previous results obtained in Practical 3 to understand the computational time gained by stepwise regression with respect to exhaustive search. Use the package tictoc for this comparison. d) (Optional) Change the simulation setting outlined above to an high dimensional one: generate from a MVN (multivariate normal) a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X_{nxp}}\\) with \\(n = 100\\) and \\(p = 150\\). Evaluate the performance of the ForwardStop rule in this high dimensional setting (i.e. by replicating the model selection task 100 times) thanks to the usual three specific criteria: the proportion of times the correct model is selected (Exact), the proportion of times the selected model contains the correct one (Correct) and the average number of selected regressors (Average \\(\\sharp\\)}). What do you observe? What is the role of \\(\\alpha\\) in this case? Consider the Malnutrition in Zambia dataset. For simplicity work only on the continuous covariates (i.e. avoiding factors) and order them according to their partial correlations using the R function fs of the Selective Inference R Package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/selectiveInference/index.html). Compare the selected models when using: the ForwardStop the StrongStop \\(\\alpha_k=\\alpha(k+1)/p\\) (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995) the \\(C_p\\) or AIC (equal in linear case) the BIC 3.2.3 Orthogonal matching pursuit The Orthogonal Matching pursuit algorithm (OMP) is a greedy algorithms for least squares regression, often called forward greedy selection in the machine learning literature. Zhang (2009) establishes the conditions for the algorithm (see below) to find the correct feature set \\(\\{j\\;\\vert \\; \\beta_j\\neq 0\\}\\) (when \\(n\\rightarrow \\infty\\)). Orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm: 1. Inputs: \\(\\mathbf{X}=[\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{p}]\\), of size \\(n\\times p\\), \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) and \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\) 2. Outputs: \\(S^{(\\ell)}\\) and \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{S^{(\\ell)}}\\) 3. Initial steps: - \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_j=\\mathbf{x}_{j}/\\|\\mathbf{x}_{j}\\|_2\\), \\(\\forall j=1,\\dots,p\\), - \\(S^{(0)}=\\emptyset\\), - \\(\\mathcal{P}=\\{1,\\ldots,p\\}\\), - \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{S^{(0)}}=\\mathbf{0}\\) 4. For\\(\\ell = 1, 2, \\ldots, p\\), do: - Set \\(j^{(\\ell)}=\\arg\\max_{j\\in \\mathcal{P}\\setminus S^{(l-1)}}|\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_j^T(\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{S^{(\\ell-1)}})|\\), - \\(|\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_{j^{(\\ell)}}^T(\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{S^{(\\ell-1)}})|\\leq \\epsilon\\) break, – Set \\(S^{(\\ell)}=\\{j^{(\\ell)}\\}\\cup S^{(\\ell-1)}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{X}_{S^{(\\ell)}}\\) the column subset of \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) with all columns \\(j\\in S^{(\\ell)}\\), – Set \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{S^{(\\ell)}}=\\left(\\mathbf{X}_{S^{(\\ell)}}^T\\mathbf{X}_{S^{(\\ell)}}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{S^{(\\ell)}}^T\\mathbf{y}\\). One can see that in the search loop (stage no 4), the variable to enter is chosen as the one to maximize the partial correlation with the response, conditioned on the current variables (selected until the previous step). Indeed \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_{j^{(\\ell)}}^T(\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{S^{(\\ell-1)}})=\\) \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_{j^{(\\ell)}}^T\\left(\\mathbf{y}-\\mathbf{X}_{S^{(\\ell-1)}}\\left(\\mathbf{X}_{S^{(\\ell-1)}}^T\\mathbf{X}_{S^{(\\ell-1)}}\\right)^{-1}\\mathbf{X}_{S^{(\\ell-1)}}^T\\mathbf{y}\\right)=\\) \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_{j^{(\\ell)}}^T\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{H}_{S^{(\\ell-1)}}\\right)\\mathbf{y}\\), and hence \\(\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_{j^{(\\ell)}}\\) is selected to maximize the drop in the residual sum of squares based on \\(S^{(\\ell)}\\). Therefore, the OMP can be used in conjunction with a model validity estimator based on the residual sum of squares (L2 norm loss function) such as the \\(C_p\\), i.e. instead of of \\(\\epsilon\\) in the OMP. There is therefore no difference between a stepwise forward regression and the OMP in terms of the variables that are chosen at each step. The only difference is that forward stepwise regression is associated with testing or optimizing a model validity criterion, while the OMP is associated to another criterion \\(\\epsilon\\). 3.2.4 Forward stagewise regression Forward stagewise regression is a smoother variation of stepwise regression that has been overlooked for a while but is coming back in high dimensional settings. It is also based on partial correlations, but at each step the chosen variable is not entered fully. It starts with all coefficients \\(\\beta_j\\) equal to zero, and iteratively updates the \\(\\beta_j\\) by a small amount \\(\\epsilon\\) of the variable \\(X_j\\) that achieves the maximal absolute correlation with the current residuals. Forward Stagewise Regression algorithm: 1. Inputs: \\(\\mathbf{X}=[\\mathbf{x}_{1},\\dots,\\mathbf{x}_{p}]\\), of size \\(n\\times p\\), \\(\\mathbf{y}\\), \\(\\epsilon&gt;0\\), \\(\\Delta\\) 2. Outputs: \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) 3. Initial steps: - standardize all covariates \\(\\rightarrow \\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_{j},j=1,\\ldots,p\\) - Set \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}^{(0)}=\\mathbf{0}\\) - Set \\(\\mathbf{e}_0=\\mathbf{y}-\\bar{y}\\), \\(\\bar{y}=1/n\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\) 4. For \\(k =1, 2, \\ldots\\), do: - \\(j=\\arg\\max_{j}|\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_j^T\\mathbf{e}_{k-1}|\\), - if \\(|\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_j^T\\mathbf{e}_{k-1}|\\leq \\Delta\\) then stop - \\(\\delta_j=\\epsilon\\;\\mbox{sign}\\left(\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_j^T\\mathbf{e}_{k-1}\\right)\\) - Set \\(\\hat{\\beta}_l^{(k+1)}\\leftarrow \\beta_l^{(k)}+\\delta_jI(l=j), l=1,\\ldots,p\\) - Set \\(\\mathbf{e}_k\\leftarrow \\mathbf{e}_{k-1}-\\delta_j\\mathbf{\\tilde{x}}_j\\) There is no clear rule for setting \\(\\epsilon\\) and \\(\\Delta\\), which makes the forward stagewise regression algorithm more an exploratory method. Obviously, \\(\\Delta\\) should be small (e.g. \\(0.0001\\)), while the smaller \\(\\epsilon\\), the more steps are needed to reach the end of the algorithm. There is actually a strong connection between the sequence of forward stagewise estimates and the solution path of the lasso; see Efron et al. (2004), and also Hastie et al. (2007), Tibshirani (2015). Exercise (optional): - Show that an ordering procedure based on stagewise regression is biased and calculate this bias for the OLS coefficient of the \\(x_j\\) predictor. Hint: Use the proof of Proposition I of Lin, Foster, and Ungar (2011). 3.3 Streamwise regression 3.3.1 Introduction Stepwise forward selection is a procedure that finds a good approximation of the the model (formed by a subset of the available covariates) that minimizes a chosen criterion (e.g. the \\(C_p\\)). It involves however, at each step \\(k\\), the comparison of \\(p-k\\) models which can be computationally very challenging. Streamwise regression (see e.g. Zhou et al. (2006) and the references therein), is a variation of stepwise regression in which covariates (predictive features) are tested sequentially for addition to the current model (or not). Because it considers each potential covariate only once, it is extremely fast. The question that arises then is, if stepwise regression is already an approximation to the optimal model in terms of model validity, how can streamwise regression, which is by construction less accurate (in terms of approximating the optimum) still be valid in some sense. There is trade-off between usable or workable procedures and reaching an optimum in high dimensions (where any, even reasonable, procedure can fail). This discussion, still widely open, goes beyond the scope of the focus of this eBook. Streamwise regression can be bound to hypothesis testing, in that the focus is placed on selecting the largest set of covariates so that their significance (rejecting their associated null hypothesis) is valid up to a global risk. These procedures mimic somehow the situation in which a global model could be estimated (not possible, so far, when \\(n&lt;p\\)) and the useful covariates, in terms of model validity, could be identified as the ones for which \\(\\mathbb{H}_{0j}=0\\) can be rejected. Care needs to be taken about not only the FWER (bound to multiple hypothesis testing) and the fact that any theoretical result (bound to the hypothesis to be tested) needs to be implemented using estimated quantities from the sample at hand, hence introducing bias and overfitting. 3.3.2 Sure Independence Screening Fan and Lv (2008) introduce the concept of sure screening and propose a sure screening method based on correlation learning which filters out the features that have weak correlation with the response. The resulting method is called sure independence screening (SIS). Sure screening is a property that insures all the important variables survive after variable screening with probability tending to 1. An important feature in high dimensions is that spurious correlations (sample correlations) between predictors can be very large. This implies that using the (sample) correlations (partial or marginal) induces a form of decisional bias because the sample (observed) quantities are misleading. For example, important predictors can be found to be highly correlated with some unimportant ones, which then makes selection tend to include more predictors than necessary. Fan and Lv (2008) provide a simulations study in which \\(p\\) independent standard normal predictors are simulated and the maximum absolute sample correlation coefficient between predictors is considered. In the Figure below are represented these quantities computed on \\(500\\) datasets with \\(n=60\\) and \\(p=1000\\) and \\(p=5000\\). Reported from Fan and Lv (2008) In the SIS framework, all covariates \\(X_j,j=1,\\ldots,p\\) are standardized (mean 0, variance 1). It is also assumed that the true model is sparse, i.e. the true dimension \\(s\\) is such that \\(s&lt;&lt;p\\). Let \\(\\mathcal{M}_s = \\{j=1,\\ldots,p \\; \\vert \\; \\beta_j \\neq 0 \\}\\) be the true sparse model with non-sparsity size \\(s=\\vert \\mathcal{M}_s\\vert\\). Let also \\(\\mathcal{M}_\\gamma\\) denote a model selected on the basis of a (streamwise) selection procedure, the sure screening property ensures that \\[\\begin{equation} P\\left(\\mathcal{M}_s\\ \\subseteq \\mathcal{M}_\\gamma\\right)\\rightarrow 1 \\end{equation}\\] The SIS procedure proposed by Fan and Lv (2008) ranks the importance of covariates (features) according to their marginal correlation with the response variable and filters out those that have weak marginal correlations with the response variable. Let \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}=(\\omega_1,\\ldots,\\omega_p) = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} \\end{equation}\\] hence, the vector of marginal correlations of predictors with the response variable (rescaled by the standard deviation of the response \\(\\mathbf{y}\\)). For any given \\(\\gamma\\in (0,1)\\), the SIS selected model is \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathcal{M}_\\gamma=\\{j=1,\\ldots,p \\;\\vert \\; \\vert \\omega_j\\;\\vert \\; \\mbox{is among the first} \\lfloor \\gamma n \\rfloor \\; \\mbox{largest}\\} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\lfloor \\gamma n \\rfloor\\) denotes the integer part of \\(\\gamma n\\). The SIS is actually used to shrink the full model of size \\(p\\) down to a submodel \\(\\mathcal{M}_\\gamma\\) with size \\(d =\\lfloor \\gamma n \\rfloor&lt;n\\). There is a link between SIS and ridge regression (Tikhonov regularization), a shrinkage method that will be presented in Chapter 4. Fan and Lv (2008) set up the conditions (Theorem 1) for the SIS to have the sure screening property, for suitable (technical) choices of \\(\\gamma\\). In particular, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}^{^1/2}\\mathbf{X}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}=\\mbox{cov}\\left(\\mathbf{X}\\right), \\mathbf{X}=\\left[X_j\\right]_{j=1,\\ldots,p}\\) has a spherically symmetric distribution. The SIS procedure can be combined with another (subset) selection method: apply the SIS to reduce the dimension, apply a selection method to the reduced dimension to get, say, \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k_1}\\) of size of order e.g. \\(n/log(n)\\). The residuals from a regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(\\mathbf{X}=[X_j],j\\in \\mathcal{M}_{k_1}\\) are then used as a new response vector and the SIS is applied to the left-aside \\(p-k_1\\) covariates to get \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k_2}\\). The rationale behind is that using the residuals from the previous step, amounts to considering partial correlations which set aside the unimportant covariates that are highly correlated with the response through their associations with the covariates present in the set \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k_1}\\) and also makes those important predictors that are missed in the previous step possible to survive. The procedure is iterated until the \\(L\\) disjoint subsets \\(\\mathcal{M}_{k_l},l=1,\\ldots,L\\) whose union \\(\\mathcal{M}_d\\) has maximal size satisfying e.g. \\(\\vert \\mathcal{M}_d\\vert&lt;n\\). This procedure is called the iterative sure independence screening (ISIS). Exercise: After having read the documentation of the R package SIS and installed it, perform the following steps: a) Load the Leukemia dataset as explained in Chapter 1. b) Split the dataset randomly in two halves (i.e. 36 observations each) and create a train and test sample. c) The functions SIS() performs first a screening procedure based on marginal correlations and then applies a penalized method (forthcoming Chapter 4 of the e-book) to obtain the final model. Choose among all the available options (i.e. in terms both of penalized methods and tuning constants) three candidates and evaluate the predictions of the selected models on the test sample. Which penalized method performs best in this specific example after the SIS? (optional) Explain why stepwise regression based on partial correlations (for the inclusion criterion) is a special case of ISIS. 3.3.3 PC-simple algorithm Bühlmann, Kalisch, and Maathuis (2010) use partial correlations to stream through the covariates and develop an algorithm that is a simplified version of the PC algorithm (Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000) used in Bayesian network modeling (Causal Bayesian Network). Moreover, they provide a criterion based on hypothesis testing to decide in a covariate is selected or not. The PC-simple algorithm is given by the following steps: 1. Set m = 1 and the active set \\(\\mathcal{M}_0\\) is empty. 2. Do correlation screening, and build the active set \\(\\mathcal{M}_1 = \\{j=1,\\ldots,p \\; \\vert \\; \\rho_{X_jY}\\neq 0 \\}\\). 3. m = m + 1. 4. Construct the \\(m\\) active set \\(\\mathcal{M}_m =\\{j \\in \\mathcal{M}_{m-1}\\; \\vert \\;\\rho_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_{C}}\\neq 0, \\; \\mathbf{X}_{C}=[X_l],l\\in\\mathcal{M}_{m-1}\\setminus\\{j\\}\\}\\). 5. Repeat from step 3 as long as \\(\\vert \\mathcal{M}_m\\vert \\leq m\\). 6. Output: \\(m_S=\\{m\\;\\vert\\; \\vert \\mathcal{M}_m\\vert \\leq m\\}\\). The PC-simple algorithm hence starts with a streamwise regression based on marginal correlations which are a particular case of partial correlations with empty conditioning set. Since this starting set might result too large, it is used as (partial) conditioning set in the next step to remove covariates with low partial correlations. The procedure stops when an equilibrium is reached, namely when the number of covariates at step \\(m\\) is the closest (and inferior) to \\(m\\). Since partial correlations need to be estimated from the available data, they are subject to sampling error, hence even if \\(\\rho_{\\cdot\\;\\cdot,\\cdot}= 0\\), \\(\\hat{\\rho}_{\\cdot\\;\\cdot,\\cdot}\\neq 0\\). Bühlmann, Kalisch, and Maathuis (2010) propose to apply Fisher’s \\(Z\\)-transformation (Fisher 1915) \\[\\begin{equation} Z_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_C}=\\frac{1}{2}\\log\\left(\\frac{1+\\hat{\\rho}_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_{C}}}{1-\\hat{\\rho}_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_{C}}}\\right) \\end{equation}\\] When testing (two-sided) \\(\\mathbb{H}_0:\\rho_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_{C}}= 0\\), \\(\\mathbb{H}_0\\) is rejected when (Fisher 1921) \\(\\sqrt{n-\\vert \\mathcal{M}_{C}\\vert-3}Z_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_C} &gt; \\Phi^{-1}\\left(1-\\alpha/2\\right)\\), where \\(\\alpha\\) is the significance level and \\(\\Phi\\) is the standard Normal cumulative distribution function. Partial correlations can be calculated recursively (Bühlmann, Kalisch, and Maathuis 2010) using \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\rho}_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_{C}}=\\frac{\\hat{\\rho}_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_{C\\setminus\\{k\\}}}-\\hat{\\rho}_{X_kY,\\mathbf{X}_{C\\setminus\\{k\\}}}\\hat{\\rho}_{X_jX_k,\\mathbf{X}_{C\\setminus\\{k\\}}}}{\\sqrt{\\left(1-\\hat{\\rho}_{X_kY,\\mathbf{X}_{C\\setminus\\{k\\}}}^2\\right)\\left(1-\\hat{\\rho}_{X_jX_k,\\mathbf{X}_{C\\setminus\\{k\\}}}^2\\right)}} \\end{equation}\\] To assess that the (population version) of the PC-simple algorithm identifies the true underlying active set, i.e. \\(\\mathcal{M}_{m_S} = \\{j = 1,\\ldots,p \\; \\vert\\; \\beta_j\\neq 0 \\}\\), Bühlmann, Kalisch, and Maathuis (2010) make use of the partial faithfulness concept. It applies to models that are such that if \\(\\forall j, j=1,\\ldots,p\\), \\(\\rho_{X_jY,\\mathbf{X}_{C}}= 0\\) for some \\(\\mathcal{M}_C\\subseteq \\mathcal{M}_p\\setminus \\{j\\}\\) implies that \\(\\beta_j=0\\) (with \\(\\mathcal{M}_p=\\{j=1,\\ldots,p\\}\\)). Partial faithfulness can only be verified when assuming a (joint) distribution for the covariates. Exercise: First of all build a simulation setting as explained below: - Generate from a MVN (multivariate normal) a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X_{n*p}}\\) with \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 10\\). Choose the location but set the scale matrix with an autoregressive form \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}=[\\sigma_{lm}]_{l,m=1,\\ldots,p}\\) with \\(\\sigma_{lm} = \\rho^{\\mid l - m\\mid}\\). - Fix \\(\\rho = 0.5\\) and set the seed equal to 11 (i.e. set.seed(11)). - Choose the generating vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta }= [3 \\; 1.5 \\; 0 \\; 2 \\; rep(0,6)]\\). - Generate \\(\\mathbf{\\hat{y}}\\) thanks to the relation \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X_{n*p}} \\; \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) where \\(\\epsilon_{i}\\) is a standard normal. Suppose for simplicity that the errors are uncorrelated. Now perform the following passages on your simulated data: a) Find the active set \\(M_{1}\\) using the Fisher’s Z transformation and the associated correlation coefficient test (fix \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) for the rest of the exercise). b) Calculate all the partial correlations of order 1 (i.e. one variable at the time) of the active set \\(M_{1}\\), test them and retrieve \\(M_{2} \\subseteq M_1\\) which is the new active set. c) Find the partial correlations of higher order and test them until your reach the condition \\(M_{m-1} = M_{m}\\) which implies the convergence of the PC-simple algorithm. Do you obtain the exact model? Exercise (project): - Write the PC-simple algorithm in R using the recursive formula for partial correlations. - Perform a simulation study to evaluate the performance (model selection criteria) both when the covariates are normally distributed and when they are not (consider e.g. factors, i.e. dummies). - Study the sensitivity of the PC-simple as a function of \\(\\alpha\\). - Apply the algorithm for variable selection in a chosen dataset. - Compare with another variable selection method (implemented). 3.4 Classification And Regression Tree (CART) Note: The Section is highly inspired from Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009), chapter 9. The regression model involves estimating the conditional mean of the response variable \\(Y\\) given a set of predictors \\(X_j, j=1,\\ldots,p\\) (collected in the \\(n\\times p\\) design matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\)), i.e. \\(\\mu(\\mathbf{X})=\\mathbf{X}\\beta, \\dim(\\beta)=p\\). The parameters \\(\\beta\\) represent the slopes of the linear regression of \\(Y\\) on \\(\\mathbf{X}\\). The basis of CART (Breiman 1984) is to approximate these slopes by partitioning the observed predictors realizations into consecutive sets, for which the observed mean response is computed. More precisely, tree-based methods partition the predictors’ space (feature space) into a set of rectangles, and then fit a simple model (i.e. computes the mean) in each one. The partitioning is done sequentially, with usually a binary partitioning (i.e. in two consecutive parts), one predictor at the time. The Figure below shows such a sequence in the case of two predictors \\(X_1, X_2\\), with splitting values \\(\\theta_m\\) and (split) regions \\(R_m, m=1,\\ldots,M, M=5\\). Illustration of the recursive binary partitioning A regression tree algorithm has the following characteristics that need to be set: - The choice of the splitting variable \\(X_j\\) (from which the split is done)in each region) - criterion for the splitting value \\(t_m:=\\theta_m\\) - the model (predictor) that is fitted in each region \\(R_m\\) - the size of the tree \\(M\\) 3.4.1 Regression tree In the linear regression model, a constant model is fitted in each region \\(R_m\\), i.e. the mth stage of the algorithm is \\[\\begin{equation} \\hat{\\mu}(\\mathbf{X})= \\sum_{m=1}^M c_m(y_i\\vert \\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_m) \\end{equation}\\] with \\[\\begin{equation} c_m(y_i\\vert \\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_m)=\\frac{1}{n_m}\\sum_i^n y_i I(\\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_m), \\\\ n_m=\\sum_i^n I(\\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_m) \\end{equation}\\] This amounts to consider, as predictor for the response, the sum of \\(m\\) local predictors computed as the mean responses \\(c_m(y_i\\vert \\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_m)\\) in each region \\(R_m\\). The slopes \\(\\beta_j\\) are then never estimated (even locally) which results in a important gain in computational time. At stage of the algorithm, two new regions are created, namely one of the former region is split into two parts. This is done for each region. A choice for the covariate \\(X_j\\) to consider for the spiting as well as the splitting value \\(t_{mj}\\) needs to be done, and the criterion is the minimization of the residual sum of squares (RSS) \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_{k=1}^m\\sum_{i \\in R_k}\\left(y_i-c_k(y_i\\vert \\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_k)\\right)^2 \\end{equation}\\] Since the contributions to the RSS of each region are computed separately (the \\(c_k(y_i\\vert \\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_k)\\)), the search for an optimum can be conducted region by region, in which both the splitting variable \\(X_j\\) and value \\(t_{mj}\\) are found that minimize the RSS in a given region. More precisely, let, at stage \\(m\\), \\(R_{m_1}(j,t_{mj})\\) and \\(R_{m_2}(j,t_{mj})\\) the regions resulting from the split of one region on the basis of one of the covariates \\(X_j\\) and according to a splitting scalar \\(t_{mj}\\), then \\(j\\) and \\(t_{mj}\\) are found using \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\min_{j,t_{mj}}&amp; \\left\\{\\sum_{i \\in R_{m_1}(j,t_{mj})} \\left(y_i-c_m(y_i\\vert \\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_{m_1}(j,t_{mj}))\\right)^2 \\right. \\\\ &amp; \\left. + \\sum_{i \\in R_{m_2}(j,t_{mj})} \\left(y_i-c_m(y_i\\vert \\mathbf{x}_i \\in R_{m_2}(j,t_{mj}))\\right)^2\\right\\} \\end{eqnarray}\\] For the size of the tree, one approach is to grow the tree until each region is very small, say of size \\(n_m\\approx 5\\), and this large tree, say \\(T_0\\), is then prunned using cost-complexity pruning based on a criterion \\(C_{\\alpha}(T)\\). Pruning generates a series of trees \\(T_{k}\\subset T_{k-1}\\subset \\ldots\\subset T_{1}\\subset T_0\\), obtained (sequentially) removing a subtree from the previous tree. A subtree is removed by removing a splitting (and the following ones) to create a collapsed region, also called leaf. The choice for the subtree to split, hence the resulting tree, say \\(T\\) of size \\(\\vert T\\vert\\), is done using a criterion based on the RSS, i.e. \\[\\begin{equation} C(T)=\\sum_{m=1}^{\\vert T\\vert}\\sum_{i\\in R_m(T)}\\left(y_i-c_m(T)\\right)^2 \\end{equation}\\] where \\(R_m(T)\\) is the \\(m\\)th region (leaf) of tree \\(T\\) and \\(c_m(T)=\\frac{1}{n_m}\\sum_i^n y_i I(\\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_m(T))\\) is the average response in region \\(R_m(T)\\). \\(C(T)\\) needs however to be constrained to avoid overfitting (since the largest possible tree is always the one that minimizes \\(C(T)\\)), so that one uses a penalized criterion given by (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman 2009) \\[\\begin{equation} C_{\\alpha}(T)=C(T) + \\alpha \\vert T\\vert \\end{equation}\\] Hence, the idea is to find, for each \\(\\alpha_k&gt;\\alpha_{k-1}&gt;\\ldots &gt; \\alpha_1&gt; \\alpha_0=0\\), the (unique) subtree \\(T_{\\alpha_k} \\subset T_{\\alpha_{k-1}}\\) that minimizes \\(C_{\\alpha}(T)\\). The tuning parameters \\(\\alpha_k\\) govern the trade off between tree size (to avoid overfitting) and its goodness of fit to the data. The sequence of \\(\\alpha_k\\) can be constructed starting from \\(\\alpha_1\\), and the sequence stops when a criterion such as tenfold cross-validation is optimized. One major problem with trees is their high variance. Often a small change in the data can result in a very different series of splits, making interpretation somewhat precarious. Averaging methods such as bagging, i.e. bootstrap aggregating, can be used to reduce the variability of the tree estimator (Breiman 1996). See Sutton (2005) for a survey. Exercise: After having read the documentation of the rpart package and having installed it, perform the following steps: Load the Zambia dataset, split it randomly in a train and test sample (common choice is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) train and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) test). For simplicity, you can consider only the continuous variables. Fit a regression tree with the function rpart() and plot the tree. Have a look at rpart.plot package if you want to improve the appearance of the fitted tree. After having pruned the tree, evaluate its prediction on the test sample (i.e. use predict() on a tree object. 3.4.2 Classification Trees Like for subset selection, if the target is a classification outcome taking values \\(q=1, 2,\\ldots,Q\\), the criterion for splitting (growing) and pruning the tree, , i.e. the RSS, needs to be adapted. Let \\(p_{mq}=1/n_m\\sum_{\\mathbf{x}_i\\in R_m}I(y_i= q)\\) be the proportion of class \\(q\\) observations in region \\(R_m\\) and let \\(q_m=\\mbox{argmax}_q p_{mq}\\), i.e. the most frequent class in region \\(R_m\\). Different alternatives to the RSS (i.e. risk measures) exist and include the following ones, specified for the region \\(R_m\\): - Misclassification error: \\(\\mbox{err}_m=\\frac{1}{n_m}\\sum_{i\\in R_m}I(y_i\\neq q_m)=1-p_{mq_m}\\) - Gini index: \\(\\mbox{err}_m=\\sum_{q=1}^Qp_{mq}(1-p_{mq})= \\sum_{q=1}^Q\\sum_{q&#39;\\neq q}p_{mq}p_{mq&#39;}\\) - Cross-entropy or deviance: \\(\\mbox{err}_m=- \\sum_{q=1}^Qp_{mq}\\log(p_{mq})\\) The total risk or error is obtained as \\(\\sum_{m=1}^R\\mbox{err}_m\\). The deviance and the Gini index have the advantage of being differentiable functions, and hence more amenable to numerical optimization. Exercise: - After having read the documentation of the rpart package and having installed it, perform the following steps: Load the Iris dataset already present in R, split it randomly in a train and test sample (common choice is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) train and \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) test). Fit a classification tree with the function rpart() and plot the tree. Have a look at rpart.plot package if you want to improve the appearance of the fitted tree. After having pruned the tree, evaluate its prediction on the test sample (i.e. use predict() on a tree object). (Optional) Analyse the Leukemia dataset by means of the regression tree method.

Program k-fold Cross-Validation (with k=2) and do model selection in a specific simulation setting with an exhaustive search. Follow these steps: Generate from a MVN (multivariate normal) a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X_{n*p}}\\) with \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 5\\). You can choose the location vector as you wish but set the scale matrix as the identity. We have chosen the location vector [2,4,6,8,10] and the scale matrix as the identity. n&lt;-1000 p&lt;-5 Mu&lt;-c(2,4,6,8,10) # location vector sigma&lt;-diag(5) # scale matrix as the identity X&lt;-mvrnorm(n , Mu, sigma) Choose the generating vector \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta }= [3 \\; 1.5 \\; 0 \\; 2 \\; 0]\\) and retrieve the signal to noise ratio of this setting. We found in Wikipedia that the statistical definition of SNR is the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation (i.e. the ratio of mean to standard deviation of a signal or measurement) : \\[SNR = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma}\\] where \\(\\mu\\) is the signal mean or expected value and \\(\\sigma\\) is the standard deviation of the noise. beta&lt;-c(3,1.5,0,2,0) e&lt;-rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1) SNR&lt;-mean(X%*%beta)/sqrt(var(e)) SNR ## [1] 27.90095 In the engineering literature, there is an alternative definition: \\[SNR_{eng} = \\frac{Var(f(x))}{Var(\\epsilon)}\\] where \\(f(x)\\) is the chosen prediction rule (e.g. linear function in the OLS case) and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the noise. You can fix in advance your SNR with the following code and generate the data accordingly: signal_to_noise_ratio = #number to fix as you wish# data = X%*%beta noise = rnorm(n,0,1) k = sqrt(var(data)/(signal_to_noise_ratio*var(noise))) y_hat_eng = data + k*noise # how you generate data to retrieve your fixed signal to noise ratio Generate \\(\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\) thanks to the relation \\(\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X_{n*p}} \\; \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\\) where \\(\\epsilon_{i}\\) is a standard normal, \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 5\\). Suppose for simplicity that the errors are uncorrelated. Y_hat&lt;-X%*%beta+e Split the data randomly in two halves (k=2) and use the training set to determine \\(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\). Then, compute the squared loss function as prediction error measure for each possible model.

The beta sometimes is not close to generating vector \\(\\beta\\) = [3 1.5 0 2 0]. Suppose now that we increase the size of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta}\\) to 100 (i.e. \\(p = 100\\) ). Calculate the number of possible models to evaluate together with an estimate of the time needed for an exhaustive search (hint: use previous results). Conclude on the feasibility of this task. ## [1] 1.267651e+30 ## [1] 6.915153e+27 When we run a CV process with p=5, it takes 0.1691079 seconds. For p = 5, we can have 31 different models thanks to Newton’s binomial theorem (i.e. \\(2^p - 1\\)). Unfortunately when we increase p to 100, we have 1.26e+30 different models. Thus it will take approximately 1.9e+24 hours. This is the case when we do k=2 cross validation. Moreover if we increase the number of k, we will drastically increase the time needed. This task is not feasible. 4.2.2 Akaike Information Criterion (solutions provided by Alexander Maslev, Hanxiong Wang and Minyoung Lee).

The estimated beta is very close to generating vector \\(\\beta\\) = [3 1.5 0 2 0]. The above results hold not considering \\(\\sigma\\) and the intercept as parameters. In the general formulation of the Akaike’s information criterion, \\(p = dim(\\Theta)\\) where \\(\\Theta\\) is the parameters space. As we computed in point (e) in CV exercise, when p = 100, we have 1.26e+30 different model. The time needed to run the AIC process with p = 5 takes 0.2441621 seconds. When we calculate the time that we need to run when p = 100, we obtain approximately 2.7e+24 hours. Thus we still think that the task to do all the combinations when p = 100 is not feasible. ## [1] 1.267651e+30 ## [1] 9.984266e+27 ## [1] 2.773407e+24 Compare the performance of your programmed CV and AIC by replicating 100 times the tasks. In particular you should evaluate three specific criteria: the proportion of times the correct model is selected (Exact), the proportion of times the selected model contains the correct one (Correct) and the average number of selected regressors (Average \\(\\sharp\\)) ## Rep 100 times AIC cv &lt;- matrix(data=NA,nrow = k,ncol = 1) Exact&lt;-data.frame(t(c(0,0))) colnames(Exact)&lt;-c(&quot;AIC&quot;,&quot;CV&quot;) AverageN&lt;-matrix(NA,nrow=100,ncol = 2) colnames(AverageN)&lt;-c(&quot;AIC&quot;,&quot;CV&quot;) Correct&lt;-data.frame(t(c(0,0))) colnames(Correct)&lt;-c(&quot;AIC&quot;,&quot;CV&quot;) for(l in 1:100){ ### SETTING ### n&lt;-1000 p&lt;-5 Mu&lt;-c(2,4,6,8,10) # location vector sigma&lt;-diag(5) # scale matrix as the identity X&lt;-mvrnorm(n , Mu, sigma) beta&lt;-c(3,1.5,0,2,0) e&lt;-rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1) Y_hat&lt;-X%*%beta+e ### AIC ### RSS&lt;-rep(0,k) AIC&lt;-rep(0,k) for(j in 1:k){ Xsub&lt;-as.matrix(X[,which(sub_matrix[j,]==1)]) betaMLE&lt;-solve(t(Xsub)%*%Xsub)%*%t(Xsub)%*%Y_hat new_Y&lt;-Xsub%*%betaMLE for(i in 1:(n/2)){ RSS[j]&lt;-RSS[j]+(new_Y[i]-Y_hat[i])^2 } AIC[j]&lt;-RSS[j]/var(e)+2*ncol(Xsub) } BEST&lt;-sub_matrix[which.min(AIC),] BEST[is.na(BEST)] &lt;-0 if(sum(BEST-c(1,1,0,1,0))==0){ Exact[1]&lt;-Exact[1]+1 } if(sum((BEST[c(1,2,4)]-c(1,1,1)))==0){ Correct[1]&lt;-Correct[1]+1 } AverageN[l,1]&lt;-sum(BEST) ### CV ### index &lt;- sample(1:n, size=0.5*n) y_train&lt;- Y_hat[-index,] x_train&lt;-X[-index,] y_test&lt;- Y_hat[index,] x_test&lt;-X[index,] for(j in 1:k){ Xsub &lt;-x_train[,which(sub_matrix[j,]==1)] betaMLE &lt;-solve(t(Xsub)%*%Xsub)%*%t(Xsub)%*%y_train new_Y &lt;-x_test[,which(sub_matrix[j,]==1)]%*%betaMLE cv[j,] &lt;- t(y_test-new_Y)%*%(y_test-new_Y) } BEST_cv&lt;-sub_matrix[which.min(cv),] BEST_cv[is.na(BEST_cv)] &lt;-0 if(sum(BEST_cv-c(1,1,0,1,0))==0){ Exact[2]&lt;-Exact[2]+1 } if(sum((BEST_cv[c(1,2,4)]-c(1,1,1)))==0){ Correct[2]&lt;-Correct[2]+1 } AverageN[l,2]&lt;-sum(BEST_cv) } Exact/100 ## AIC CV ## 1 0.84 0.47 Correct/100 ## AIC CV ## 1 1 1 colMeans(AverageN) ## AIC CV ## 3.20 3.63 In this part, we have simulated the AIC process and the CV process for 100 times and evaluated the three criteria. We have found that AIC gives better results than CV in terms of Exact models and it has a lower number of selected regressors on average. Both methods achieves model selection consistency in this simple setting as the proportion of correct models reaches the value of 1. This result is expected since AIC is derived from the likelihood which inherits all the nice properties (e.g. Cramer-Rao bound etc.) when the model is correct. On the other hand, CV is a non parametric method thus inferior by definition to the AIC in this setting. However in a real application our conjectured model maybe far from the truth and CV could be a better choice. In the same simulation setting outlined in the CV exercise section, generate from a MVN (multivariate normal) a matrix \\(\\mathbf{X_{n*p}}\\) with \\(n = 1000\\) and \\(p = 5\\) but now fix the scale matrix with an autoregressive form \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}=[\\sigma_{lm}]_{l,m=1,\\ldots,p}\\) with \\(\\sigma_{lm} = \\rho^{\\mid l - m\\mid}\\). Compare the performance of CV and AIC for \\(\\boldsymbol{\\rho} = [0.2 \\; 0.5\\; 0.7]\\) (\\(\\rho = 0\\) corresponds to the identity case that you have already treated). There are different sources of randomness: X matrix, epsilon (error), y (induced) and the split for CV.We need to choose what to preserve: we replicate every time only the randomness of epsilon and of course the split of the CV thus we need to set a seed for the X matrix. All this discussion on randomness is pivotal for a significant and controlled simulation setting. require(MASS) set.seed(5) # For the X matrix n = 1000 p = 5 rho = 0.5 # change rho as you please to inspect other correlations among the predictors mu = rep(1,p) sigma = rep(0,p^2) sigma = matrix(data = sigma, ncol = p,nrow = p) # Autoregressive structure for (i in 1:p) { for (j in 1:p) { sigma[i,j] = rho^(abs(i-j)) } } X = mvrnorm(n,mu,sigma) # beta = c(0,0,1,0,0) alternative beta to check bias properties beta = c(3,1.5,0,2,0) ind = 1:1000 pos_CV = rep(0,100) pos_AIC = rep(0,100) for(z in 1:100) { y_hat = X%*%beta + rnorm(n,0,1) data = data.frame(cbind(y_hat,X)) colnames(data) = c(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;x1&quot;,&quot;x2&quot;,&quot;x3&quot;,&quot;x4&quot;,&quot;x5&quot;) index = sample(x = ind,size = 500,replace = F) train_set = data[index,] test_set = data[-index,] cv_error = rep(0,31) aic_values = rep(0,31) # One regressor only models for(i in 1:5) { m_1 = lm(train_set$y ~ train_set[,i+1], data = train_set) cv_error[i] = mean((test_set$y - (cbind(rep(1,500),test_set[,i+1])%*% m_1$coefficients))^2) m_1 = lm(data$y ~ data[,i+1], data) aic_values[i] = -2*logLik(m_1) + 2*3 } # Two regressors models x = c(1,2,3,4,5) M = combn(x,2) for(i in 1:10) { m_2 = lm(train_set$y ~ train_set[,M[1,i]+1] + train_set[,M[2,i]+1], data = train_set) cv_error[i+5] = mean((test_set$y - cbind(rep(1,500),test_set[,M[1,i]+1], test_set[, M[2,i] +1])%*%m_2$coefficients)^2) m_2 = lm(data$y ~ data[,M[1,i]+1] + data[,M[2,i]+1], data) aic_values[i+5] = -2*logLik(m_2) + 2*4 } # Three regressors models M = combn(x,3) for(i in 1:10) { m_3 = lm(train_set$y ~ train_set[,M[1,i]+1] + train_set[,M[2,i]+1] + train_set[,M[3,i]+1], data = train_set) cv_error[i+ 15] = mean((test_set$y - cbind(rep(1,500),test_set[,M[1,i]+1], test_set[, M[2,i] +1],test_set[, M[3,i]+1])%*%m_3$coefficients)^2) m_3 = lm(data$y ~ data[,M[1,i]+1] + data[,M[2,i]+1] + data[,M[3,i]+1], data) aic_values[i+15] = -2*logLik(m_3) + 2*5 } # Four regressors models M = combn(x,4) for(i in 1:5) { m_4 = lm(train_set$y ~ train_set[,M[1,i]+1] + train_set[,M[2,i]+1] + train_set[,M[3,i]+1] + train_set[,M[4,i]+1], data = train_set) cv_error[i+25] = mean((test_set$y - cbind(rep(1,500),test_set[,M[1,i]+1], test_set[, M[2,i] +1],test_set[, M[3,i]+1],test_set[, M[3,i]+1])%*% m_4$coefficients)^2) m_4 = lm(data$y ~ data[,M[1,i]+1] + data[,M[2,i]+1] + data[,M[3,i]+1] + data[,M[4,i]+1], data) aic_values[i+25] = -2*logLik(m_4) + 2*6 } # Full model full_model = lm(train_set$y ~ ., data = train_set) full_model$coefficients cv_error_full = mean((test_set$y - cbind(rep(1,500), test_set$x1,test_set$x2,test_set$x3,test_set$x4,test_set$x5)%*% full_model$coefficients)^2) cv_error[31] = cv_error_full full_model = lm(data$y ~ ., data) aic_values[31] = -2*logLik(full_model) + 2*7 pos_CV[z] = which.min(cv_error) pos_AIC[z] = which.min(aic_values) } # We know that the right position should be 17 which is the exact model. # Exact model proportion sum(pos_CV == &quot;17&quot;)/100 ## [1] 0.48 sum(pos_AIC == &quot;17&quot;)/100 ## [1] 0.71 # Correct model proportion (linked to the consistency of the model selection procedure) sum(pos_CV &gt; 16)/100 ## [1] 1 sum(pos_AIC &gt; 16)/100 ## [1] 1 # Average number of regressors counted = c(rep(1,5),rep(2,10), rep(3,10), rep(4,5),5) result_cv = rep(0,100) result_aic = rep(0,100) for (i in 1:100) { result_cv[i] = counted[pos_CV[i]] result_aic[i] = counted[pos_AIC[i]] } # CV CASE mean(result_cv) ## [1] 3.8 # AIC case mean(result_aic) ## [1] 3.3 CONCLUSIONS: correlation does not play a role here because it biases our estimates but not that much that is necessary to make AIC (less so CV) fails to recognize the significant regressors. This holds especially in the presence of strong signal so for a beta with important components. The transition chain is: we create correlated X, we transmit correlation to the ys, the likelihood theory is not optimal anymore (y should be independent, X fixed) and I get biased estimates. However I need a really important bias to make AIC fails to recognize significant variables in the linear case. The GLM case is different: correlation is a real issue because of the link function. Even a small bias in that direction can alter the order of variables and thus AIC results. Upload the Zambia dataset and perform an exhaustive search on the continuous covariates (i.e. avoiding factors) based on CV and AIC in order to find the best model.

Then load the Leukemia dataset reduced which contains a subset of 11 eleven predictors among the 3571 present in the leukemia_small.csv. These variables have been selected, because of their importance, by the binary lasso which is a shrinkage method that will be discussed later on in the course.
